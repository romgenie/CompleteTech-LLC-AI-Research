# Research Understanding Engine

This module is responsible for processing AI research papers to extract implementable details such as algorithms, model architectures, hyperparameters, and evaluation methodologies.

## Components

The Research Understanding Engine consists of several key components:

- **Paper Processing System**: Extracts structured information from research papers
- **Algorithm Extraction Module**: Identifies and formalizes algorithms described in papers
- **Model Architecture Analyzer**: Extracts neural network and model designs
- **Implementation Detail Collector**: Gathers hyperparameters and configuration details
- **Evaluation Methodology Extractor**: Identifies evaluation methods and metrics

## Functionality

The Research Understanding module provides the following key functionality:

1. Processing and structuring research papers
2. Extracting algorithms from pseudocode and natural language descriptions
3. Analyzing and extracting model architectures from diagrams and text
4. Identifying implementation details such as hyperparameters
5. Extracting evaluation methodologies, datasets, and metrics

## Usage

```python
from research_implementation.research_understanding.paper_processor import PDFExtractor
from research_implementation.research_understanding.model_analysis import ModelArchitectureAnalyzer

# Extract and process a research paper
extractor = PDFExtractor()
paper_content = extractor.extract("https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.12092.pdf")

# Analyze model architecture
model_analyzer = ModelArchitectureAnalyzer()
architecture = model_analyzer.analyze(paper_content)

# Print model architecture details
print(f"Model type: {architecture.type}")
print(f"Number of layers: {len(architecture.layers)}")
for i, layer in enumerate(architecture.layers):
    print(f"Layer {i+1}: {layer.type} - {layer.parameters}")
```

## Integration Points

- Provides extracted research details to the **Implementation Planning** module
- Works with **open_deep_research** adapter for enhanced paper processing
- Interfaces with **KARMA** adapter for knowledge extraction
- Supports conversion between different framework representations

## Development Status

Current focus areas:
- Improving PDF extraction quality
- Enhancing algorithm extraction from pseudocode
- Refining model architecture recognition
- Expanding support for different AI domains (vision, NLP, RL)
