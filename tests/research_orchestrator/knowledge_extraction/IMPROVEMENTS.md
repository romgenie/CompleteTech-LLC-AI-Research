# Knowledge Extraction Testing and Processing Improvements

## Integration Test Fixes
- Fixed import paths from `src.research_orchestrator` to `research_orchestrator` in all integration test files
- Updated entity type references from `EntityType.ORGANIZATION` to `EntityType.INSTITUTION` to match current entity type definitions
- Fixed references to entity and relationship objects in integration tests to use the correct entity types
- Corrected relationship extraction tests to match the current model types and relationship classes

## Property and Edge Case Test Fixes
- Fixed import paths for property tests and edge case tests
- Corrected module reference from `research_orchestration` to `research_orchestrator` in relationship property tests
- Updated entity type references to match the current entity type definitions
- Added proper handling for overlapping entities and conflicting relationships in test cases

## Benchmark System Enhancements

- Enhanced HTML report generation with a tabbed interface for better organization
- Added historical data tracking to compare performance across benchmark runs
- Added visualizations for memory usage and scaling metrics
- Added cleanup functionality to manage old benchmark reports (keeps only the last 10)
- Created an index page to navigate between benchmark reports
- Improved error handling for test failures to include error details in the report
- Added scaling metrics interpretation to identify performance issues
- Improved chart rendering with responsive design and better visualization options
- Added offline capabilities by embedding necessary JavaScript libraries

## Error Handling Improvements in Document Processing
- Added comprehensive error handling for file access, permission, and encoding issues

- Updated conftest.py files to use consistent import patterns
- Standardized test file organization and naming conventions

## Fixes for Test Fixtures
- Added missing test fixtures for entity recognition and relationship extraction tests
- Fixed entity type references in test fixtures to match the current entity model
- Added proper initialization for test fixtures with realistic test data
- Fixed circular imports and dependency issues in test fixtures
- Implemented contextual fixture generation to support different test scenarios

## Documentation Additions
- Added comments explaining error handling strategies
- Enhanced docstrings with explicit exception information
