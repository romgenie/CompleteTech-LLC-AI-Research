Title: Advances in Large Language Models: A Comparative Analysis

Abstract
This paper provides a comparative analysis of recent large language models including GPT-4, PaLM, and Claude. We evaluate their performance on various benchmarks including MMLU, HumanEval, and GSM8K. Our findings indicate that GPT-4 achieves state-of-the-art performance across most benchmarks, with particularly strong results in reasoning tasks. We discuss implications for future research and applications of these models.

1. Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing in recent years. These transformer-based models, trained on massive text corpora, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human language. Among the most prominent models are GPT-4 developed by OpenAI, PaLM developed by Google, and Claude developed by Anthropic.

These models have significantly advanced the state of the art in various NLP tasks, from question answering to code generation. Their capabilities have important implications for applications ranging from conversational AI to automated programming assistance.

2. Model Architectures

All models examined in this study are based on the transformer architecture introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017). However, they differ in several important aspects:

GPT-4 follows the decoder-only architecture of its predecessors but with significantly increased model size and training data. While the exact parameters are not publicly disclosed, it is estimated to have over 1 trillion parameters.

PaLM (Pathways Language Model) uses a modified transformer architecture with 540 billion parameters. It was trained using Google's Pathways system, which enables training across thousands of accelerator chips.

Claude, developed by Anthropic, is trained using constitutional AI methods and focuses on alignment with human values. Its architecture builds upon the transformer design with modifications to enhance safety and helpfulness.

3. Benchmark Performance

We evaluated these models on several established benchmarks:

MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding): GPT-4 achieved 86.4% accuracy, outperforming PaLM (76.2%) and Claude (75.5%).

HumanEval (Python code generation): GPT-4 achieved 67.0% pass@1, compared to 58.4% for PaLM and 56.0% for Claude.

GSM8K (grade school math problems): GPT-4 scored 92.0%, followed by PaLM at 80.7% and Claude at 78.5%.

BIG-Bench: All models performed well on this diverse set of tasks, with GPT-4 leading on 80% of the subtasks.

4. Training Methodology

All models were implemented using PyTorch and trained on NVIDIA A100 GPUs. The training process involved several stages:

Pre-training on diverse text corpora including books, articles, and web pages.
Fine-tuning with instruction data to improve task performance.
Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to align with human preferences and values.

5. Discussion and Conclusion

Our analysis shows that GPT-4 currently leads performance across most benchmarks, though all models show strengths in different areas. The rapid advancement in model capabilities suggests continued progress in the field.

Future work should explore specialized training techniques to improve performance on specific tasks, as well as methods to enhance model interpretability and reduce biases.
