            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Computer vision has seen remarkable progress in recent years, with models like ViT, CLIP, and Stable Diffusion pushing the boundaries of what's possible. In this post, we'll explore the current state of the field and highlight some of the most impressive models.

            <h2>Transformer-Based Vision Models</h2>
            <p>
                The Vision Transformer (ViT), introduced by Google Research in 2020, adapts the transformer architecture originally designed for NLP to image recognition tasks. By treating images as sequences of patches, ViT achieves competitive performance compared to convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
            </p>
            <p>
                CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training), developed by OpenAI, represents a significant advance in multimodal learning. By training on 400 million image-text pairs from the internet, CLIP can perform zero-shot classification and has demonstrated remarkable versatility across various vision tasks.

            <h2>Diffusion Models</h2>
            <p>
                Diffusion models have revolutionized image generation. DALL-E 2, created by OpenAI, can generate high-quality images from text descriptions, showing impressive understanding of complex concepts and compositions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Stable Diffusion, developed by Stability AI, is an open-source diffusion model that has gained widespread adoption. Based on the latent diffusion architecture, it offers high-quality image generation while requiring less computational resources than DALL-E 2.
            </p>
            <p>
                Midjourney has become popular for its aesthetically pleasing generations, often with an artistic quality that appeals to creative professionals.

            <h2>Performance Comparison</h2>
            <p>
                These models employ different architectures and training methodologies:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>ViT uses a pure transformer architecture and was trained on ImageNet and JFT-300M datasets.</li>
                <li>CLIP uses a dual-encoder architecture (vision and text) and was trained on 400M image-text pairs.</li>
                <li>DALL-E 2 combines CLIP with diffusion models for its text-to-image generation.</li>
                <li>Stable Diffusion uses latent diffusion models trained on LAION-5B dataset.</li>
                <li>Midjourney's architecture is proprietary but likely uses diffusion techniques.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                On standard benchmarks like ImageNet, ViT-L/16 achieves 87.8% top-1 accuracy. CLIP's zero-shot capabilities allow it to achieve 76.2% on ImageNet without fine-tuning.

            <h2>Implementation Frameworks</h2>
            <p>
                Most of these models are implemented using PyTorch, which has become the dominant framework for research in computer vision. TensorFlow remains popular in production environments, particularly for serving models at scale.
            </p>
            <p>
                The training of these models typically requires significant GPU resources. For example, training Stable Diffusion required approximately 150,000 A100-GPU-hours, demonstrating the computational intensity of current state-of-the-art models.

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                The field of computer vision has been transformed by these recent advances. Transformer-based architectures and diffusion models have opened new possibilities for image understanding and generation. As these technologies continue to mature, we can expect even more impressive capabilities in the coming years.
