    GPT-4 is a large language model developed by OpenAI. It was trained on a massive dataset
    of text and code, and it outperforms previous models like GPT-3.5 on many benchmarks.
    The model was evaluated on tasks such as the MMLU benchmark, where it achieved
    86.4% accuracy. Researchers implemented the model using PyTorch and trained it
    on NVIDIA A100 GPUs with distributed training techniques.
    
    BERT is a transformer-based language model that was developed by Google AI.
    It uses a bidirectional training approach and is based on the transformer architecture.
    BERT has been fine-tuned for various NLP tasks and has achieved state-of-the-art results
    on benchmarks like GLUE and SQuAD.
