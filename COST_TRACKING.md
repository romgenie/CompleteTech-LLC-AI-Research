## Phase 4.0 Budget Projection - Temporal Evolution Layer

The Temporal Evolution Layer implementation (Phase 4.0) is projected to require:

- **Estimated Cost**: $30.00 - $40.00
- **Estimated API Duration**: 2h 30m - 3h 30m
- **Estimated Wall Duration**: 8h 00m - 10h 00m

This projection is based on the complexity of implementing:
1. Temporal entity versioning system with version trees and identity linking
2. Time-aware relationship types with validity periods and evolutionary dynamics
3. Temporal query engine with time-window filtering and timeline visualization
4. Evolution pattern detection for research trend analysis
5. Predictive evolution modeling for research direction forecasting

## Phase 3.5 Budget Projection - Paper Processing Pipeline

The Paper Processing Pipeline implementation (Phase 3.5) is projected to require:

- **Estimated Cost**: $35.00 - $45.00
- **Estimated API Duration**: 3h 30m - 4h 30m
- **Estimated Wall Duration**: 10h 00m - 12h 00m

This projection is based on the complexity of implementing:
1. Asynchronous processing architecture with Celery and Redis
2. State machine for paper lifecycle management
3. Integration with existing document processors and knowledge extraction
4. Real-time WebSocket updates and comprehensive API endpoints
5. Algorithm extraction and code generation capabilities

## Frontend Enhancement Budget Projection

The parallel frontend enhancement work is projected to require:

- **Estimated Cost**: $20.00 - $25.00
- **Estimated API Duration**: 2h 00m - 2h 30m

This covers:
1. Knowledge Graph performance optimization for large datasets
2. Accessibility improvements for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
3. TypeScript migration for core contexts and hooks
4. Citation management and research organization features
5. Performance optimizations with React Query

## Cost Efficiency Measures

To optimize cost efficiency during Phase 3.5 implementation:

1. **Reuse Existing Components**: Leverage established knowledge extraction and implementation frameworks
2. **Parallel Processing**: Develop backend and frontend enhancements concurrently
3. **Systematic Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing early to reduce rework
4. **Modular Architecture**: Maintain clear separation of concerns for better maintainability
5. **Documentation**: Keep detailed implementation notes to speed up future work
