# AI Research Integration Project - System Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the AI Research Integration Project's system architecture, detailing the components, their interactions, and design decisions.

## 1. System Overview

The AI Research Integration Project is a comprehensive platform that combines capabilities from multiple AI research repositories to create an end-to-end system for AI research discovery, knowledge extraction, and implementation. The system consists of three main components:

1. **Research Orchestration Framework**: Coordinates the research process from query to report generation
2. **Dynamic Knowledge Graph System**: Builds and maintains knowledge graphs of AI research
3. **Research Implementation System**: Automatically implements and tests AI research concepts

   - Optimized for relationship-heavy operations

2. **MongoDB**: Document store for research content and implementation details
   - Flexible schema for different document types
   - Efficient storage for large text documents and code snippets
   - Support for embedded documents and arrays

### 3.3 Containerization

The system is containerized using Docker and Docker Compose, allowing for easy deployment and scaling.

#### Container Structure

- **API Service**: FastAPI application container
- **Neo4j**: Knowledge graph database container

## 4. Frontend Architecture

### 4.1 React Component Structure

The frontend is built using React with a component-based architecture.

#### Key Components

- **Layout Components**: Provide consistent page structure
- **Authentication Components**: Handle user authentication and authorization
