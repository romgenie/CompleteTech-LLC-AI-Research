# Paper Processing Pipeline Implementation Plan

## Overview

The Paper Processing Pipeline is a system for extracting knowledge from academic papers and integrating it into our knowledge graph system. This plan outlines the implementation details for Phase 3.5 of the project, focusing on the asynchronous processing architecture.

## Current Status

The foundation for the Paper Processing Pipeline has been laid with:

- ✅ Core data models defined
- ✅ State machine architecture for paper lifecycle management
- ✅ Database integration design
- ✅ Celery task queue configuration
- ✅ API route structure

## Implementation Goals

Phase 3.5 will focus on:

1. **Completing the Asynchronous Processing Architecture**
   - Implementing full Celery integration
   - Setting up reliable task chaining
   - Configuring worker pools and scaling

2. **Implementing Document Processing Components**
   - PDF, HTML, and text extraction
   - OCR for scanned papers
   - Metadata extraction

3. **Implementing Entity and Relationship Extraction**
   - Integration with NLP models
   - Entity recognition and classification
   - Relationship extraction and validation

4. **Building Knowledge Graph Integration**
   - Entity and relationship mapping
   - Graph construction and validation
   - Conflict resolution

5. **Implementing Real-time Status Updates**
   - WebSocket notifications
   - Progress tracking
   - Status dashboard

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

```
Upload → Queue → Process Document → Extract Entities → Extract Relationships → Build Knowledge Graph → Analyze → Implementation Ready
```
