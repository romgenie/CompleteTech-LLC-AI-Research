# Knowledge Extractor Module

This module is responsible for extracting structured knowledge from various information sources including academic papers, code repositories, and web content.

## Components

The Knowledge Extractor module consists of several key components:

- **Source Connector Framework**: Interfaces with academic databases, code repositories, and web sources
- **Document Processing Pipeline**: Handles various formats (PDFs, HTML, code, etc.)
- **Entity Recognition System**: Identifies AI concepts, methods, models, and datasets
- **Relationship Extraction Engine**: Determines relationships between entities
- **Quality Assessment Module**: Evaluates reliability of extracted information

## Functionality

The Knowledge Extractor provides the following key functionality:

1. Connecting to and retrieving information from various sources
2. Processing different document formats into standardized text
3. Identifying AI-specific entities within the processed text
4. Extracting relationships between identified entities
5. Assessing the quality and reliability of extracted information

## Usage

```python
from knowledge_graph_system.knowledge_extractor.source_connector import AcademicAPIClient
from knowledge_graph_system.knowledge_extractor.document_processor import PDFProcessor
from knowledge_graph_system.knowledge_extractor.entity_recognition import AITerminologyRecognizer

# Connect to academic source and retrieve paper
academic_client = AcademicAPIClient()
paper_data = academic_client.get_paper("https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.02155")

# Process PDF
pdf_processor = PDFProcessor()
processed_text = pdf_processor.process(paper_data.pdf_url)

# Extract AI terminology
recognizer = AITerminologyRecognizer()
entities = recognizer.extract_entities(processed_text)

# Print identified entities
for entity in entities:
    print(f"{entity.type}: {entity.name} (confidence: {entity.confidence})")
```

## Integration Points

- Provides extracted knowledge to the **Knowledge Graph** module
- Interfaces with external APIs through the **Source Connector Framework**
- Primary integration point with **KARMA** for knowledge extraction capabilities
- Works with **open_deep_research** adapter for enhanced information gathering

## Development Status

Current focus areas:
- PDF extraction optimization
- AI terminology recognition improvements
- Relationship extraction accuracy
- Source credibility evaluation
