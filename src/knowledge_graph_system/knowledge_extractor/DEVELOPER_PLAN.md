## Technical Specifications

### Entity Data Model

```python
class Entity:
    id: str
    name: str
    type: str  # "concept", "algorithm", "model", "dataset", etc.
    aliases: List[str]
    description: str
    attributes: Dict[str, Any]
    source_references: List[SourceReference]
    confidence: float
    
class Relationship:
    id: str
    source_entity_id: str
    target_entity_id: str
    type: str  # "implements", "outperforms", "builds_on", etc.
    attributes: Dict[str, Any]
    source_references: List[SourceReference]
    confidence: float
    
class SourceReference:
    source_id: str
    source_type: str  # "paper", "code", "web"
    citation_info: Dict[str, Any]
    context: str
    extraction_date: datetime
```

### API Endpoints

- Document processor tests with various document formats
- Entity recognition tests with known AI concepts
- Relationship extraction tests with sample texts
- Quality assessment tests with varying source qualities

### Integration Tests

- End-to-end extraction pipeline tests
- KARMA integration tests
- open_deep_research integration tests

## Dependencies

- spaCy and Hugging Face Transformers for NLP
- PyPDF2 and pdfminer.six for PDF processing
- BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing
- GitPython for repository analysis
- KARMA adapter for enhanced extraction

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| API rate limits | Reduced data gathering capability | Implement caching and rate limit management |
| PDF extraction errors | Missing or corrupted knowledge | Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms |
| Entity recognition accuracy | Incorrect knowledge extraction | Use ensemble methods and confidence thresholds |
| Relationship extraction complexity | Missed or incorrect relationships | Start with high-precision patterns, gradually improve recall |
| Source credibility assessment | Including unreliable information | Conservative credibility scoring with human verification |
