# Dynamic Knowledge Graph System for AI Research

A comprehensive system for building, maintaining, and leveraging knowledge graphs of AI research, capable of identifying patterns, trends, and knowledge gaps.

## Overview

The Dynamic Knowledge Graph System creates a living map of AI research by extracting knowledge from papers, code repositories, and web sources, integrating it into a structured graph, and providing insights through advanced analysis. The system is designed to help researchers discover connections between concepts, identify emerging trends, and uncover promising research directions.

## Key Features

- **Automated Knowledge Graph Construction**: Extract entities and relationships from research literature
- **Multi-source Knowledge Integration**: Combine information from papers, code, and web sources
- **Dynamic Graph Evolution**: Update knowledge representations as new research emerges
- **Contradiction Detection and Resolution**: Identify and handle conflicting information
- **Pattern and Trend Discovery**: Uncover emerging research areas and declining topics
- **Knowledge Gap Identification**: Discover promising unexplored research directions
- **Research Question Generation**: Automatically formulate novel research questions
- **Interactive Visualization**: Explore the knowledge graph visually

## Architecture

The system consists of five core components:

1. **Multi-source Knowledge Extractor**: Processes various information sources to extract structured knowledge
2. **Evolving Knowledge Graph**: Maintains a dynamic, interconnected representation of AI concepts
3. **Graph-based Agent Network**: Coordinates specialized agents using optimized graph topologies
4. **Insight Generation System**: Discovers patterns, contradictions, and gaps in knowledge
5. **Research Guidance Interface**: Provides actionable insights and research directions

## Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/knowledge_graph_system.git
cd knowledge_graph_system

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up Neo4j database
docker-compose up -d neo4j

# Configure API credentials
cp config/api_credentials.yaml.example config/api_credentials.yaml
# Edit the file to add your credentials
```

## Usage

### Python API

```python
from knowledge_graph_system.core.system import KnowledgeGraphSystem

# Initialize the system
system = KnowledgeGraphSystem()

# Extract knowledge from papers
papers = ["https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971", "https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08774"]
system.extract_knowledge(sources=papers, source_type="papers")

# Query the knowledge graph
results = system.query_graph("MATCH (a:Algorithm)-[r:OUTPERFORMS]->(b:Algorithm) RETURN a, r, b")

# Generate insights
trends = system.generate_insights(insight_type="trends", timeframe="last_5_years")
gaps = system.generate_insights(insight_type="knowledge_gaps", domain="reinforcement_learning")

# Generate research questions
questions = system.generate_research_questions(topic="transformer_architecture", count=5)
```

### Web Interface

The system also provides a web interface for interactive exploration:

1. Start the web server: `python -m knowledge_graph_system.api.server`
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
3. Use the interface to search, visualize, and interact with the knowledge graph
