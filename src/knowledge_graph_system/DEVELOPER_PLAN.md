# Knowledge Graph System - Developer Plan

## Overview

The Knowledge Graph System is designed for building and maintaining comprehensive knowledge graphs of AI research to identify patterns, trends, and knowledge gaps. This plan outlines the development approach, architecture, and integration with the Paper Processing Pipeline.

## Core Components

### Graph Database Management

- **Neo4jManager**: Handles connection and query management
- **SchemaManager**: Manages graph constraints and indexes
- **QueryOptimizer**: Optimizes queries for performance

### Knowledge Graph Models

- **GraphEntity**: Base class for graph entities
- **GraphRelationship**: Base class for graph relationships
- **AIModel**, **Dataset**, **Paper**, etc.: Specialized entity models
- **TrainedOn**, **Outperforms**, etc.: Specialized relationship models

### Knowledge Graph Manager

- **KnowledgeGraphManager**: High-level manager for graph operations
- **ConnectionDiscovery**: Finds potential connections between entities
- **ContradictionResolution**: Handles conflicting information

### Knowledge Graph Adapter

- **KnowledgeGraphAdapter**: Interface for Research Orchestrator
- **EntityConverter**: Converts between formats
- **RelationshipConverter**: Converts between formats

## Development Approach

1. **Phase 1**: Core database connectivity and models
   - Neo4j connection management
   - Base entity and relationship models
   - Schema definition and validation

2. **Phase 2**: Knowledge graph operations
   - Entity and relationship management
   - Query utilities and optimization
   - Basic statistics and monitoring

3. **Phase 3**: Advanced features
   - Connection discovery
   - Contradiction resolution
   - Temporal tracking

4. **Phase 3.5**: Paper Processing Integration
   - Connect with Paper Processing Pipeline
   - Add paper-specific entity and relationship types
   - Implement citation network analysis

## Technical Decisions

1. **Neo4j as Graph Database**
   - Native graph database with powerful query language
   - Support for complex graph algorithms
   - Scalable and well-documented

2. **Modular Design** for extensibility
   - Abstract base classes with clear interfaces
   - Inheritance for specialized entities and relationships
   - Adapter pattern for external integrations

3. **Schema Design**
   - Comprehensive schema for AI research entities and relationships
   - Constraints for data integrity
   - Indexes for query performance

## Integration with Paper Processing Pipeline

### Current State
Currently, the Knowledge Graph System can store entities and relationships extracted from papers, but lacks automated integration with the paper upload process. Papers are not automatically processed and added to the knowledge graph.

### Future Integration (Phase 3.5)

1. **Knowledge Graph Storage for Processed Papers**:
   - Create Paper node type with all metadata
   - Link paper nodes to all extracted entities and relationships
   - Implement paper version tracking for evolving research
   - Build source attribution for all knowledge

2. **Citation Network Analysis**:
   - Extract and represent paper citations as graph relationships
   - Identify citation patterns and influential papers
   - Calculate citation-based metrics
   - Visualize citation networks and research influence

3. **Cross-Paper Knowledge Integration**:
   - Connect entities across multiple papers
   - Identify confirmations and contradictions in research
   - Track concept evolution across publications over time
   - Generate research timelines and evolution paths

4. **Knowledge Gap Identification**:
   - Analyze graph structure to identify missing connections
   - Highlight areas with limited research
   - Suggest potential research directions
   - Quantify research coverage across topics

5. **Paper-Specific Queries and Analytics**:
   - Find papers discussing specific entities or relationships
   - Identify papers with contradicting findings
   - Analyze methodology differences between related papers
   - Track research trends and emerging topics

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests** for individual components
   - Test database connectivity
   - Test entity and relationship management
   - Test query utilities

2. **Integration Tests** for component interactions
   - Test the knowledge graph workflow
   - Test adapter integration

3. **System Tests** for full knowledge graph functionality
   - Test with real research papers
   - Test advanced features

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Month 1**: Core database connectivity and models
2. **Month 2**: Knowledge graph operations
3. **Month 3**: Advanced features
4. **Month 4+**: Integration with Paper Processing Pipeline (Phase 3.5)

## Dependencies

- **External**: Neo4j, KARMA
- **Internal**: Research Orchestrator, Research Implementation

## Risk Assessment

1. **Graph Scalability**
   - Mitigation: Proper indexing, query optimization, chunking large operations

2. **Data Quality and Consistency**
   - Mitigation: Schema constraints, validation checks, contradiction resolution

3. **Query Performance**
   - Mitigation: Query optimization, caching, indexes

4. **Integration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Clear interfaces, adapter pattern, comprehensive testing

This plan adheres to the project architecture and implementation priorities outlined in CODING_PROMPT.md, with special attention to the integration with the Paper Processing Pipeline planned for Phase 3.5.
