# Collaborative Tagging Implementation

## Overview

This PR implements the collaborative tagging system, extending our existing hierarchical tag functionality to support sharing, collaboration, and community-based organization. This enhancement allows users to:

- Share tags with specific users or groups with configurable permission levels
- Discover popular and community-created tags
- Receive AI-generated tag suggestions based on content and community patterns
- Resolve conflicts in competing taxonomies
- View analytics on tag usage and trends

## Key Components

### Data Model Enhancements
- Enhanced `Tag` interface with visibility, sharing, and community properties
- Added taxonomies for organizing collections of tags
- Created permission models for collaboration
- Added conflict detection and resolution data models

### Service Layer
- Extended `tagsService.ts` with sharing, suggestion, and analytics capabilities
- Created new `taxonomyService.ts` for taxonomy management
- Added hooks for React components to interact with these services

### UI Components
- Implemented `TagDiscovery` for discovering shared and suggested tags
- Created `TagSharingDialog` for managing tag visibility and permissions
- Implemented `TagConflictResolution` for handling taxonomy conflicts
- Built `TagAnalytics` for visualizing usage statistics
- Enhanced `TagManagementPage` with the new collaborative features

## How It Works

1. **Tag Visibility & Sharing**
   - Tags can be private, shared with specific users/groups, or public
   - Granular permissions control who can view, use, edit, or administer tags
   - Sharing dialog makes permission management intuitive

2. **Tag Discovery**
   - Users can explore popular tags across the community
   - AI-generated suggestions based on content and usage patterns
   - Browsing interface for exploring global and shared tags

3. **Conflict Resolution**
   - System detects taxonomy conflicts (hierarchy, naming, classification)
   - Interactive interface for resolving conflicts
   - Multiple resolution strategies (merge, move, rename, split)

4. **Usage Analytics**
   - Visualization of tag usage trends over time
   - Co-occurrence analysis showing related tags
   - User adoption metrics for community insights

## Testing

- Component tests for key UI elements
- Service method unit tests
- Mock data for disconnected development

## Documentation

- Added comprehensive feature documentation in `/docs/features/`
- Created implementation details in `/docs/implementation/`
- Updated existing tag documentation with collaboration capabilities

## Next Steps

This implementation lays the groundwork for our upcoming machine learning recommendation system, which will leverage the collaborative tag data to provide personalized research suggestions.
