## Implementation Approach

Our implementation approach emphasizes:

1. **Parallel Development**
   - Work on performance and TypeScript simultaneously
   - Each day has specific, measurable deliverables
   - Daily commits with comprehensive testing

2. **Test-Driven Development**
   - Write tests before implementation
   - Ensure backward compatibility
   - Validate all use cases

3. **Accessibility-First**
   - Consider accessibility from the beginning
   - Test with screen readers and keyboard navigation
   - Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards

4. **Performance Metrics**
   - Establish baseline performance
   - Measure improvements with each optimization
   - Document performance gains

## Technical Guidelines

### Component Structure

```
ComponentName/
  ├── index.js          # Main export
  ├── ComponentName.js  # Component implementation
  ├── ComponentName.test.js  # Unit tests
  └── styles.js         # Component-specific styles
```

### TypeScript Guidelines

- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Add proper JSDoc comments
- Create generic versions of hooks
- Implement proper error types

### Accessibility Guidelines

- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible
- Use proper ARIA roles and attributes
- Provide text alternatives for visual information
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Support screen readers with announcements

## Testing Plan

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Test all custom hooks individually
   - Validate component rendering and interactions
   - Test utility functions for edge cases

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Test component interactions
   - Validate API integration
   - Test WebSocket functionality

3. **Performance Tests**
   - Measure render times for large graphs
   - Test with 1000+ node datasets
   - Validate memory usage

4. **Accessibility Tests**
   - Test keyboard navigation
   - Validate with automated tools (axe, lighthouse)
   - Test with screen readers

## Success Criteria

Our implementation will be considered successful when:

1. **Performance**
   - Knowledge Graph visualization handles 10,000+ nodes smoothly
   - UI remains responsive with large datasets
   - No frame drops during interactions

2. **Accessibility**
   - Passes WCAG 2.1 AA compliance checks
   - Fully keyboard navigable
   - Screen reader compatible

3. **Developer Experience**
