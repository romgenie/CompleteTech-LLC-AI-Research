# AI Research Integration Frontend - Project Plan

## Overview
The AI Research Integration frontend provides a user interface for interacting with the research orchestration, knowledge graph, and paper implementation systems. It allows users to conduct research, visualize knowledge graphs, and generate implementations from research papers.

## Current Status (March 2025)
- âœ… Core application architecture implemented
- âœ… Authentication system working with JWT
- âœ… Dashboard with overview of system capabilities
- âœ… Research page for conducting research queries
- âœ… Knowledge Graph page with D3.js visualization
- âœ… Implementation page for code generation from papers
- âœ… Responsive layout for all device sizes
- âœ… Mock data fallbacks for disconnected development
- âœ… Real-time updates with WebSocket integration
- âœ… Paper processing visualization and tracking
- âœ… Knowledge graph filtering and search capabilities
- âœ… Paper upload interface with metadata editing
- âœ… Comprehensive error handling system
