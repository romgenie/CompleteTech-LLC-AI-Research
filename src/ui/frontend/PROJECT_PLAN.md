# AI Research Integration Frontend - Project Plan

## Overview
The AI Research Integration frontend provides a user interface for interacting with the research orchestration, knowledge graph, and paper implementation systems. It allows users to conduct research, visualize knowledge graphs, and generate implementations from research papers.

## Current Status (March 2025)
- ✅ Core application architecture implemented
- ✅ Authentication system working with JWT
- ✅ Dashboard with overview of system capabilities
- ✅ Research page for conducting research queries
- ✅ Knowledge Graph page with D3.js visualization
- ✅ Implementation page for code generation from papers
- ✅ Responsive layout for all device sizes
- ✅ Mock data fallbacks for disconnected development
