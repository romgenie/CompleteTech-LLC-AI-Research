### Browsers
- Chrome (latest version)
- Firefox (latest version)
- Safari (latest version)
- Edge (latest version)

### Input Methods
- Keyboard only
- Mouse only
- Touch screen
- Screen reader + keyboard

### Display Settings
- High contrast mode (OS level)
- Zoom at 200%
- Font size increased to 200%
- Reduced motion settings enabled

## Test Cases

### 1. High Contrast Mode

#### 1.1 Theme Toggle
- [ ] Verify theme settings menu is keyboard accessible
- [ ] Confirm toggle buttons change states correctly
- [ ] Validate theme changes apply immediately
- [ ] Verify preference is saved and persists between sessions
- [ ] Check announcement to screen readers when theme changes

#### 1.2 Visual Verification
- [ ] Check all text meets minimum contrast ratio 4.5:1
- [ ] Verify interactive elements have visible boundaries
- [ ] Confirm that focus indicators are clearly visible
- [ ] Check form fields are distinguishable
- [ ] Verify icons and graphics maintain meaning

#### 1.3 Knowledge Graph in High Contrast
- [ ] Verify node colors are distinguishable
- [ ] Confirm relationship lines are visible
- [ ] Check node labels are readable
- [ ] Verify selected nodes have clear visual indication
- [ ] Confirm focus state is clearly visible

### 2. Keyboard Navigation

#### 2.1 Keyboard Focus
- [ ] Verify all interactive elements can receive keyboard focus
- [ ] Confirm focus moves in a logical order
- [ ] Check focus is visible at all times
- [ ] Verify focus is never trapped (except in modals)
- [ ] Confirm no keyboard shortcuts interfere with screen readers

#### 2.2 Knowledge Graph Navigation
- [ ] Check arrow keys navigate between nodes
- [ ] Verify Tab key navigates UI controls properly
- [ ] Confirm Home/End keys work as documented
- [ ] Test zoom controls (+/- keys)
- [ ] Verify node selection with Enter/Space
- [ ] Check toggle between graph and table view works

#### 2.3 Table View Navigation
- [ ] Verify table rows can be navigated with arrow keys
- [ ] Check sorting functions are keyboard accessible
- [ ] Confirm filtering is accessible via keyboard
- [ ] Test pagination controls with keyboard
- [ ] Verify selected row has proper visual and ARIA indication

### 3. Screen Reader Accessibility

#### 3.1 Page Structure
- [ ] Verify proper heading structure (h1, h2, etc.)
- [ ] Check ARIA landmarks are present and correct
- [ ] Confirm page title updates appropriately
- [ ] Verify skip links function correctly
- [ ] Check all regions are properly labeled

#### 3.2 Interactive Elements
- [ ] Verify buttons have meaningful accessible names
- [ ] Check form inputs have proper labels
- [ ] Confirm error messages are announced
- [ ] Verify custom controls have appropriate roles
- [ ] Check toggle/switch states are announced

#### 3.3 Knowledge Graph with Screen Readers
- [ ] Test graph node navigation and announcements
- [ ] Check entity selection announcements
- [ ] Verify table view provides complete information
- [ ] Confirm filtering and sorting are announced
- [ ] Test keyboard shortcuts with screen reader active

#### 3.4 Dynamic Content
- [ ] Verify live regions announce updates
- [ ] Check alerts and notifications are properly announced
- [ ] Confirm loading states are communicated
- [ ] Verify modals and dialogs function with screen readers
- [ ] Test form submission feedback

### 4. Alternative Text and Media

- [ ] Check all images have appropriate alt text
- [ ] Verify complex visualizations have detailed descriptions
- [ ] Confirm data visualizations have table alternatives
- [ ] Check any videos have proper captions
- [ ] Verify no information is conveyed by color alone

### 5. Compatibility Tests

#### 5.1 Browser Compatibility
- [ ] Test all features in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- [ ] Verify screen reader compatibility with each browser
- [ ] Check behavior with browser zoom at 200%
- [ ] Verify no content is lost at different viewport sizes

#### 5.2 Mobile Accessibility
- [ ] Test with TalkBack on Android
- [ ] Verify VoiceOver functionality on iOS
- [ ] Check touch targets are appropriately sized
- [ ] Confirm responsive design at various screen sizes
- [ ] Test orientation changes on mobile devices

## Testing Methodology

### Automated Testing
1. Run Lighthouse accessibility audit
2. Execute axe-core tests for WCAG violations
3. Check keyboard navigation with automated tools
4. Verify color contrast with WCAG Color Contrast Analyzer

### Manual Testing
1. Conduct keyboard-only navigation testing
2. Perform screen reader testing with multiple readers
3. Test with OS high contrast mode
4. Validate with real users of assistive technology

## Reporting Accessibility Issues

Issues found during testing should be documented with:

1. Steps to reproduce
2. Expected vs. actual behavior
3. Screenshots or recordings
4. Browser/screen reader/OS information
5. Severity level
   - Critical: Makes feature unusable for users with disabilities
   - Major: Significantly hinders use but workarounds exist
   - Minor: Inconvenient but doesn't prevent use

## Critical User Flows to Test

1. **Search and Explore Knowledge Graph**
   - Navigate to Knowledge Graph page
   - Perform a search
   - Select an entity
   - Explore the visualization
   - Switch to table view
   - Navigate connections

2. **Research Query Flow**
   - Navigate to Research page
   - Enter a research query
   - Review results
   - Explore citations
   - Navigate to related topics

3. **User Settings and Preferences**
   - Open user settings
   - Change theme preferences
   - Update accessibility options
   - Verify settings persist

## Success Criteria

The accessibility implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All WCAG 2.1 AA success criteria are met
2. Knowledge Graph is fully navigable by keyboard
3. All information is accessible via screen readers
4. High contrast mode provides sufficient visual distinction
5. Table view provides a complete alternative to the visualization
6. All keyboard shortcuts function as documented
