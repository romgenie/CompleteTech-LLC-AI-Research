# Next Steps for Frontend Development

## Week 1: TypeScript Migration & Knowledge Graph Performance (Completed)

### TypeScript Migration Tasks
- ✅ **Core Type Definitions**: Created comprehensive types in `/src/types/index.ts`
- ✅ **Context API Migration**: Converted AuthContext and WebSocketContext to TypeScript
- ✅ **Custom Hooks Migration**: Converted all core hooks (useD3, useFetch, useWebSocket, useLocalStorage, useErrorBoundary)

1. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - ✅ Implemented keyboard navigation for graph visualization
   - ✅ Added arrow key navigation between connected nodes
   - ✅ Implemented focus management for nodes
   - [ ] Extend keyboard navigation to all UI elements

2. **ARIA Attributes**
   - ✅ Added appropriate ARIA roles, labels to visualization
   - ✅ Implemented accessible node and link descriptions
   - [ ] Extend ARIA attributes to all components

3. **Screen Reader Support**
   - ✅ Created KnowledgeGraphAccessibility component
   - ✅ Added text-based node information
   - [ ] Complete testing with VoiceOver and NVDA

4. **Text-Based Alternative View**
   - ✅ Added tabular node connection display
   - [ ] Create full semantic HTML table view of graph data
   - [ ] Implement text-based mode toggle

5. **High Contrast Mode**
   - ✅ Defined color schemes with sufficient contrast
   - ✅ Implemented high contrast mode toggle
   - ✅ Created theme context with 4 theme variants (light, dark, high contrast light, high contrast dark)
   - ✅ Added high contrast color schemes for Knowledge Graph visualization
   - ✅ Integrated with accessibility component to show current mode
   - ✅ Verified all colors meet WCAG AA contrast ratio

### TypeScript Migration Continuation
- [ ] Continue migrating remaining services and utility functions
- [ ] Convert page components to TypeScript
- [ ] Add type checking for API interfaces
- [ ] Implement runtime validation with type guards
