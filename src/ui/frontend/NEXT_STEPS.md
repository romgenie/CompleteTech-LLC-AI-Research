# Next Steps for Frontend Development

## Week 1: Continuation of TypeScript Migration & Knowledge Graph Performance (Current)

### TypeScript Migration Tasks
- ✅ **Core Type Definitions**: Created comprehensive types in `/src/types/index.ts`
- ✅ **Context API Migration**: Converted AuthContext and WebSocketContext to TypeScript
- ✅ **Custom Hooks Migration**: Converted all core hooks (useD3, useFetch, useWebSocket, useLocalStorage, useErrorBoundary)
- ✅ **Auth Service Migration**: Converted authService to TypeScript

#### Upcoming Tasks - Week 1 (Day 4-5)
1. **Component Migration (Priority Components)**
   - [ ] Convert `StatusIndicator.js` → `StatusIndicator.tsx`
   - [ ] Convert `PaperStatusCard.js` → `PaperStatusCard.tsx`
   - [ ] Convert `ErrorBoundary.js` → `ErrorBoundary.tsx`
   - [ ] Convert `ErrorFallback.js` → `ErrorFallback.tsx`
   - [ ] Convert `LoadingFallback.js` → `LoadingFallback.tsx`

2. **Knowledge Graph Performance Improvements**
   - [ ] Implement smart node filtering with Set-based lookups for O(1) performance
   - [ ] Develop dynamic node sizing based on connectivity
   - [ ] Test & benchmark with large dataset (1000+ nodes)

## Week 2: Accessibility Implementation & Hook Typing

### Accessibility Tasks
1. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - [ ] Implement keyboard navigation for graph visualization
   - [ ] Ensure all interactive elements have proper focus states
   - [ ] Create meaningful focus order

2. **ARIA Attributes**
   - [ ] Add appropriate ARIA roles, labels, and descriptions
   - [ ] Implement ARIA live regions for dynamic content

3. **Screen Reader Support**
   - [ ] Test with screen readers (VoiceOver, NVDA)
   - [ ] Ensure all interactive elements have accessible names
   - [ ] Add descriptive text for complex visualization elements

4. **Text-Based Alternative View**
   - [ ] Create semantic HTML table view of graph data
   - [ ] Implement text-based mode toggle

5. **High Contrast Mode**
   - [ ] Implement high contrast color scheme
   - [ ] Ensure all colors meet WCAG AA contrast ratio of 4.5:1

### TypeScript Migration Continuation
- [ ] Continue migrating remaining services and utility functions
- [ ] Convert page components to TypeScript
- [ ] Add type checking for API interfaces
- [ ] Implement runtime validation with type guards

## Week 3: Citation Management & Performance Optimization

### Citation Tasks
- [ ] Implement BibTeX and APA citation formats
- [ ] Add MLA and Chicago citation formats
- [ ] Create citation export UI with previews
- [ ] Build reference management panel
- [ ] Implement DOI lookup and enrichment

### Performance Improvements
- [ ] Research React Query integration options
- [ ] Set up React Query for API caching
- [ ] Implement background refetching and prefetching
- [ ] Add virtualization for long citation lists
- [ ] Optimize component rendering with memoization

## Week 4: Research Organization & UX Standardization

### Research Organization Tasks
- [ ] Implement research history with localStorage
- [ ] Add favorites functionality with persistence
- [ ] Create tagging system for query management
- [ ] Build advanced filtering for search history
- [ ] Add search statistics and export capabilities

### UX Improvements
- [ ] Create consistent UI components library
- [ ] Implement step-by-step guided workflows
- [ ] Add progressive disclosure for advanced options
- [ ] Implement unified error handling and feedback
- [ ] Create comprehensive help documentation
