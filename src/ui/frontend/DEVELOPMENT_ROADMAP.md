# AI Research Integration Frontend - Development Roadmap

This document outlines the detailed roadmap for the AI Research Integration Frontend, focusing on near-term development priorities, technical guidelines, and implementation details.

## Phase 3 Roadmap (Q3-Q4 2025)

### 1. TypeScript Migration (In Progress)

TypeScript migration is being implemented incrementally to ensure a smooth transition while maintaining application stability.

#### Completed:
- ✅ Added JSDoc type definitions in `src/utils/typeDefs.js` as an interim solution
- ✅ Added TypeScript configuration with `tsconfig.json`

#### Next Steps:
1. **Core Contexts Migration**
   - Convert AuthContext to TypeScript
   - Convert WebSocketContext to TypeScript
   - Add comprehensive interface definitions for context values

2. **Custom Hooks Migration**
   - Convert useD3 hook to TypeScript
   - Convert useFetch hook to TypeScript
   - Convert useWebSocket hook to TypeScript
   - Convert useLocalStorage hook to TypeScript

3. **Component Migration Strategy**
   - Focus first on shared components with clear prop interfaces
   - Convert error handling components (ErrorBoundary, ErrorFallback, LoadingFallback)
   - Convert reusable UI components next (StatusIndicator, NotificationCenter)
   - Convert complex components like KnowledgeGraphFilter and PaperDashboard last

4. **API Type Definitions**
   - Create comprehensive interface definitions for all API models
   - Implement proper type validation for API responses
   - Add runtime type checking for API interactions

### 2. Knowledge Graph Visualization Enhancements

The next major focus is enhancing the Knowledge Graph visualization to support large datasets and advanced analysis.

#### Planned Improvements:
1. **Dynamic Rendering for Large Graphs**
   - Implement level-of-detail rendering based on zoom level
   - Add node clustering for dense regions of the graph
   - Implement WebGL-based rendering for graphs with 1000+ nodes

2. **Specialized Visualization Modes**
   - Add hierarchical layout mode for tree-like structures
   - Implement radial layout for certain relationship types
   - Create force-directed layout with configurable parameters

3. **Export and Sharing**
   - Add PNG/SVG export functionality
   - Implement graph data export in JSON format
   - Add capability to share graph via URL with encoded state

4. **Analysis Tools**
   - Add path finding between entities
   - Implement centrality and importance metrics
   - Add filtering based on graph algorithms

### 3. Performance Optimizations

Performance improvements are critical for handling larger datasets and providing a smooth user experience.

#### Planned Optimizations:
1. **React Query Integration**
   - Implement React Query for all API calls
   - Add caching with appropriate invalidation policies
   - Implement background refetching for important data
   - Add optimistic updates for UI responsiveness

2. **Virtualization**
   - Add virtualization for long lists (papers, entities, etc.)
   - Implement windowing for large data tables
   - Create infinite scrolling for paginated data

3. **Memoization and Rendering Optimization**
   - Audit and optimize component re-renders
   - Add strategic memoization for expensive calculations
   - Implement Code Splitting for all major feature areas

### 4. Research Enhancement

Improving the research experience with better tools and capabilities.

#### Planned Features:
1. **Citation Management**
   - Add source citation tracking 
   - Implement reference management
   - Create citation export in multiple formats

2. **Research History**
   - Add history of research queries
   - Implement favorites and saved queries
   - Create research collections/folders

3. **Export and Sharing**
   - Add export to PDF, Markdown, and HTML
   - Implement collaborative research sessions
   - Create shareable research links

### 5. Technical Debt and Developer Experience

Improving the codebase health and developer experience.

#### Planned Improvements:
1. **Code Quality Tools**
   - Add Prettier for consistent formatting
   - Implement Husky with pre-commit hooks
   - Add ESLint with TypeScript rules

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Set up Jest with React Testing Library
   - Implement Mock Service Worker for API testing
   - Add E2E testing with Cypress for critical flows
   - Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline

3. **Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive component documentation
   - Add API documentation with examples
   - Implement automatic documentation generation

4. **Accessibility**
   - Add comprehensive accessibility testing
   - Implement keyboard navigation improvements
   - Ensure screen reader compatibility
   - Add high contrast mode support

## Implementation Guidelines

### Component Architecture

All new components should follow these guidelines:

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component should have a single, well-defined purpose
2. **Proper TypeScript Types**: Use proper TypeScript interfaces for props and state
3. **Error Handling**: Implement appropriate error boundaries and fallbacks
4. **Performance**: Consider React.memo for pure components and useMemo for expensive calculations
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation are properly implemented
6. **Testing**: Create comprehensive tests covering component behaviors

### State Management

1. **Context API**: Use for global application state (auth, theme, etc.)
2. **React Query**: Use for server state (data fetching, caching, etc.)
3. **Local State**: Use for UI-specific state within components
4. **Custom Hooks**: Extract complex state logic into reusable hooks

### Styling Guidelines

1. **Material UI**: Use Material UI components for consistency
2. **Theme Variables**: Always use theme variables for colors, spacing, etc.
3. **Responsive Design**: Ensure all components work across device sizes
4. **Component Props**: Use sx prop for component-specific styling
5. **Dark Mode**: Support both light and dark themes

## Success Metrics

The following metrics will be used to evaluate the success of Phase 3:

1. **Performance**:
   - Lighthouse performance score > 90
   - Load time < 2 seconds for initial page load
   - 60fps for all animations and interactions

2. **Code Quality**:
   - TypeScript coverage > 90%
   - Test coverage > 80%
   - 0 critical or high severity issues in security audit

3. **User Experience**:
   - Support for knowledge graphs with 10,000+ nodes
   - Paper processing status updates within 1 second
   - Accessible to WCAG 2.1 AA standard
