## Implementation Guidelines

### Component Architecture

All new components should follow these guidelines:

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component should have a single, well-defined purpose
2. **Proper TypeScript Types**: Use proper TypeScript interfaces for props and state
3. **Error Handling**: Implement appropriate error boundaries and fallbacks
4. **Performance**: Consider React.memo for pure components and useMemo for expensive calculations
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation are properly implemented
6. **Testing**: Create comprehensive tests covering component behaviors
7. **UX Standards**: Follow the UX standards established in the Knowledge Graph Explorer:
   - Implement meaningful empty states with guidance
   - Use progressive disclosure for complex features
   - Add tooltips and contextual help
   - Provide immediate visual feedback for actions
   - Follow consistent information architecture
8. **Visual Consistency**: Maintain design language consistency with existing components

### State Management

1. **Context API**: Use for global application state (auth, theme, etc.)
2. **React Query**: Use for server state (data fetching, caching, etc.)
3. **Local State**: Use for UI-specific state within components
4. **Custom Hooks**: Extract complex state logic into reusable hooks

### Styling Guidelines

1. **Material UI**: Use Material UI components for consistency
2. **Theme Variables**: Always use theme variables for colors, spacing, etc.
3. **Responsive Design**: Ensure all components work across device sizes
4. **Component Props**: Use sx prop for component-specific styling
5. **Dark Mode**: Support both light and dark themes
