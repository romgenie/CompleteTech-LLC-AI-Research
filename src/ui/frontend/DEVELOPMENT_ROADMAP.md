   - âœ… Added multi-format export functionality (JSON, CSV, Neo4j Cypher)
   - âœ… Implemented PNG/SVG export for visualizations
   - âœ… Added share functionality for visualization state
   - ðŸ”„ URL state encoding for sharing specific views (planned for future update)

4. **Research-Focused Analysis Tools** âœ…
   - âœ… Added network metrics (nodes, relationships, density)
   - âœ… Implemented research frontier identification
   - âœ… Added visual indicators for emerging fields
   - âœ… Centrality metrics and community detection
   - ðŸ”„ Advanced graph algorithms (planned for future update)

#### Next Steps:
1. **Performance for Large Graphs**
   - Optimize rendering for graphs with 1000+ nodes
   - Implement WebGL-based rendering for very large datasets
   - Add progressive loading for large knowledge graphs

### 3. Performance Optimizations

Performance improvements are critical for handling larger datasets and providing a smooth user experience.

#### Planned Optimizations:

   - Add optimistic updates for UI responsiveness

2. **Virtualization**
   - Add virtualization for long lists (papers, entities, etc.)
   - Implement windowing for large data tables
   - Create infinite scrolling for paginated data

3. **Memoization and Rendering Optimization**
   - Audit and optimize component re-renders
   - Add strategic memoization for expensive calculations
   - Implement Code Splitting for all major feature areas

### 4. Research Enhancement

Improving the research experience with better tools and capabilities.

#### Planned Features:
1. **Citation Management**
   - Add source citation tracking 
   - Implement reference management
   - Create citation export in multiple formats

2. **Research History**
   - Add history of research queries

   - Create research collections/folders

3. **Export and Sharing**
   - Add export to PDF, Markdown, and HTML
   - Implement collaborative research sessions
   - Create shareable research links

### 5. Technical Debt and Developer Experience

Improving the codebase health and developer experience.

#### Planned Improvements:
1. **Code Quality Tools**
   - Add Prettier for consistent formatting
   - Implement Husky with pre-commit hooks
   - Add ESLint with TypeScript rules

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Set up Jest with React Testing Library
   - Implement Mock Service Worker for API testing
   - Add E2E testing with Cypress for critical flows
   - Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD pipeline

3. **Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive component documentation
   - Add API documentation with examples
   - Implement automatic documentation generation

4. **Accessibility**
   - Add comprehensive accessibility testing
   - Implement keyboard navigation improvements
   - Ensure screen reader compatibility
   - Add high contrast mode support

## Docker & Development Environment

To facilitate easier development and testing, we've implemented Docker configurations:

1. **Development Environment**:
   - Docker Compose setup for development with hot reloading
   - Configuration in `docker/docker-compose.dev.yml`

2. **Mock API Server**:
   - Standalone API server that simulates all backend functionality
   - Includes authentication, CRUD operations, and WebSocket support
   - Provides realistic mock data and real-time updates
   - Configuration in `docker/docker-compose.mock.yml`

3. **Production Build**:
   - Optimized production build with Nginx
   - Configuration in `docker/Dockerfile` and `docker/nginx.conf`

4. **Full Stack Deployment**:
   - Complete application stack with all services
   - Configuration in `docker-compose.yml`

## Implementation Guidelines

### Component Architecture

All new components should follow these guidelines:

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each component should have a single, well-defined purpose
2. **Proper TypeScript Types**: Use proper TypeScript interfaces for props and state
3. **Error Handling**: Implement appropriate error boundaries and fallbacks
4. **Performance**: Consider React.memo for pure components and useMemo for expensive calculations
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation are properly implemented
6. **Testing**: Create comprehensive tests covering component behaviors

### State Management

1. **Context API**: Use for global application state (auth, theme, etc.)
2. **React Query**: Use for server state (data fetching, caching, etc.)
3. **Local State**: Use for UI-specific state within components
4. **Custom Hooks**: Extract complex state logic into reusable hooks

### Styling Guidelines

1. **Material UI**: Use Material UI components for consistency
2. **Theme Variables**: Always use theme variables for colors, spacing, etc.
3. **Responsive Design**: Ensure all components work across device sizes
4. **Component Props**: Use sx prop for component-specific styling
5. **Dark Mode**: Support both light and dark themes

## Success Metrics

The following metrics will be used to evaluate the success of Phase 3:

1. **Performance**:
   - Lighthouse performance score > 90
   - Load time < 2 seconds for initial page load
   - 60fps for all animations and interactions
