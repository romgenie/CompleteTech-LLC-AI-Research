  - Tag usage distribution
  - Popular search terms analysis

- **Statistics Components**:
  - `ResearchStats.tsx`: Main statistics visualization component
  - `ResearchStatsPage.tsx`: Dedicated page for analytics
  - Data export functionality for further analysis

### 3. Research Recommendations

Personalized recommendation system based on research behavior:

- **Recommendation Engine**:
  - Tag-based recommendations using frequency analysis
  - Query-based recommendations for research continuation
  - Trending topics tailored to user interests
  - Combination recommendations from tag intersections

- **Research Insights**:
  - Pattern recognition in research behavior
  - Knowledge gap identification
  - Research optimization suggestions
  - Time-based research pattern analysis

- **Recommendation Components**:
  - `ResearchRecommendationCard.tsx`: Individual recommendation display

  - `ResearchInsightCard.tsx`: Research insight display
  - `ResearchInsightList.tsx`: Categorized insights view
  - `ResearchRecommendationsPage.tsx`: Dedicated recommendations page

### 4. Citation Management

Comprehensive citation management system:

- **Multiple Citation Styles**:
  - Support for APA, MLA, Chicago, IEEE, Harvard, Vancouver, and BibTeX
  - Consistent formatting across all citation styles
  - Proper handling of different publication types

- **Import/Export Capabilities**:
  - DOI and ArXiv lookup integration
  - BibTeX export for reference managers
  - Multiple export formats (txt, html, bibtex)

### 5. Research Organization System

Integrated system for research query management:

- **Favorites System**:
  - Bookmark functionality for important queries
  - Persistence with localStorage
  - Toggle interface for adding/removing favorites
  - Filtering by favorites status

- **Advanced Filtering**:
  - Multi-criteria filtering with tags, dates, and search terms
  - Real-time filter application
  - Saved filter configurations
  - Filter panel with responsive design

- **Search History Tracking**:
  - Automatic logging of research queries
  - Historical analysis of search patterns
  - Quick access to previous searches
  - Reusable query library

## Implementation Details

### Data Models

The organization features use these core data structures:

```typescript
// Tag system
interface Tag {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  color?: string;
  description?: string;
  count?: number;
}

// Research stats
interface ResearchStats {
  totalQueries: number;
  savedQueries: number;
  favorites: number;
  tagCounts: Record<string, number>;
  topSearchTerms: Array<{term: string, count: number}>;
  queriesByDate: Array<{date: string, count: number}>;
  averageResultsPerQuery: number;
}

// Recommendations
interface ResearchRecommendation {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  confidence: number;
  basedOn: RecommendationSource[];
  tags?: Tag[];
  suggestedQueryText?: string;
}

// Research insights
interface ResearchInsight {
  id: string;
  type: 'trend' | 'gap' | 'pattern' | 'suggestion';
  title: string;
  description: string;
  importance: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  relatedTags?: Tag[];
  iconType?: string;
}
```

### Service Layer Integration

All organization features integrate with these services:

- **researchService.ts**: Core research operations
- **recommendationService.tsx**: Recommendation generation and management
- **citationService.ts**: Citation formatting and management
- Local storage for persistence of favorites, tags, and settings

### Performance Optimizations

The implementation includes these optimizations:

- **React Query Integration**:
  - Efficient data fetching and caching
  - Background refetching for fresh data
  - Query invalidation for data consistency
  - Optimistic updates for responsive UI

- **Component Optimizations**:
  - Memoization of expensive calculations
  - Virtualization for long lists
  - Lazy loading of components
  - Efficient D3.js rendering with cleanup

- **Local Storage**:
  - Strategic caching of frequently accessed data
  - Minimized storage footprint
  - Versioning for schema migrations
  - Fallback mechanisms for browser limitations

## Documentation
