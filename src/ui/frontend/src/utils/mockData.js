However, research also shows that efficient scaling with high-quality data and architectural improvements can yield comparable performance with smaller models. Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures have gained popularity for creating computationally efficient large models."

Continued pre-training and instruction tuning remain effective for adapting models to specific domains."

These capabilities enable new applications in document understanding, visual reasoning, and multimodal content generation."

Models can now use external tools, such as calculators, web browsers, and code interpreters, extending their capabilities beyond their trained knowledge. This represents a shift toward LLMs as orchestrators of other specialized systems."

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train.",
