# UI for AI Research Integration Project

This module contains the web-based user interface for the AI Research Integration Project.

## Overview

The UI provides a user-friendly interface for:

1. **Research Querying**: Submit research queries and view results
2. **Knowledge Graph Visualization**: Explore and visualize AI research knowledge
3. **Research Report Generation**: Create and customize research reports
4. **Implementation Management**: Request and track paper implementations

## Architecture

The UI consists of:

- **Frontend**: React-based single-page application
- **Backend Integration**: API clients for connecting to the FastAPI backend
- **Visualization Components**: D3.js for knowledge graph visualization

## Technology Stack

- React for UI components
- D3.js for data visualization
- Axios for API communication
- JWT for authentication
- Material-UI for component library

## Directory Structure

```

## Setup and Running

### Development

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

2. Start the development server:
```bash
npm start
```

3. Access the UI at http://localhost:3000

### Production

1. Build the frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

2. Serve the static files from a web server or the backend API

## Authentication

The UI uses JWT authentication to communicate with the API:

1. Login page collects user credentials
2. Auth service exchanges credentials for JWT token
3. Token is stored in localStorage/sessionStorage
4. Subsequent API calls include the token in Authorization header
5. Protected routes check for valid token
