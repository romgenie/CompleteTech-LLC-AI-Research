"""
API routes for the Paper Processing Pipeline.

This module defines the FastAPI routes for the Paper Processing Pipeline,
providing endpoints for controlling paper processing and retrieving status.
The foundation routes have been implemented as part of Phase 3.5 as outlined
in CODING_PROMPT.md, with full functionality coming in the upcoming sprints.

Current Implementation Status:
- API route structure is defined ✓
- Endpoint stubs with proper documentation are implemented ✓
- Status reporting endpoints are functional ✓
- Processing request endpoints defined ✓

Upcoming Development:
- Full task execution in process endpoints
- Real-time WebSocket status updates
- Batch processing with progress tracking
- Advanced search and statistics
