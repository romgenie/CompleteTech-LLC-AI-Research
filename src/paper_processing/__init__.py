"""
Paper Processing Pipeline Package.

This package implements the Paper Processing Pipeline for the AI Research
Integration Project. It is currently in the planned stage (Phase 3.5) as
outlined in CODING_PROMPT.md.

The package will provide functionality for:
1. Processing uploaded papers
2. Extracting knowledge using existing components
3. Integrating with the Knowledge Graph System
4. Triggering implementations in the Research Implementation System

Currently, papers can be uploaded but remain in the "uploaded" status.
This package will be implemented as the fourth implementation priority,
following the completion of the core components.
