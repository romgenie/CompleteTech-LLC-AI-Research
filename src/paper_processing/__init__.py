Paper Processing Pipeline Package.

This package implements the Paper Processing Pipeline for the AI Research
Integration Project. The foundation architecture has been implemented as part of
Phase 3.5 as outlined in CODING_PROMPT.md.

The package provides functionality for:
1. Processing uploaded papers
2. Extracting knowledge using existing components
3. Integrating with the Knowledge Graph System
4. Triggering implementations in the Research Implementation System

Current Implementation Status:
- Core state machine architecture is implemented ✓
- Paper data models and states are defined ✓
- Celery task infrastructure is set up ✓
- API endpoint stubs are implemented ✓
- Integration interfaces are defined ✓

Upcoming Development:
- Full task implementation for paper processing
- Knowledge extraction and graph integration
- Implementation readiness analysis
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates
- Performance optimization and scaling

For detailed development plans, see the paper_processing_plan.md document.
