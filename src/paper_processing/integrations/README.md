# Integration Adapters for Paper Processing Pipeline

## Overview

This directory contains adapters for integrating the Paper Processing Pipeline with other components of the AI Research Integration Project. These adapters follow the adapter pattern to maintain clean separation of concerns.

## Components

### Knowledge Graph Adapter

The Knowledge Graph Adapter (`knowledge_graph.py`) integrates the Paper Processing Pipeline with the Knowledge Graph System:

- **Entity Conversion**: Maps paper entities to knowledge graph entities
- **Relationship Mapping**: Maps paper relationships to knowledge graph relationships
- **Graph Integration**: Adds papers and their extracted knowledge to the graph
- **Citation Network**: Builds citation networks between papers

### Research Implementation Adapter

The Research Implementation Adapter (`research_implementation.py`) integrates with the Research Implementation System:

- **Algorithm Extraction**: Identifies implementable algorithms from papers
- **Implementation Requests**: Creates implementation requests from papers
- **Status Tracking**: Monitors implementation progress
- **Verification**: Validates implementations against paper claims

### Research Orchestrator Adapter

The Research Orchestrator Adapter (`research_orchestrator.py`) integrates with the Research Orchestration Framework:

- **Research Generation**: Creates research queries based on papers
- **Workflow Integration**: Registers paper processing workflows
- **Task Creation**: Creates research tasks from papers
- **Coordination**: Coordinates the paper processing pipeline

### Extraction Adapter

The Extraction Adapter (`extraction.py`) integrates with the Knowledge Extraction Pipeline:

- **Document Processing**: Processes paper documents to extract text
- **Entity Recognition**: Extracts entities from paper content
- **Relationship Extraction**: Identifies relationships between entities
- **Knowledge Coordination**: Coordinates the extraction process

## Usage

The adapters are initialized with their respective dependencies and provide methods for integrating with the corresponding systems. They are used by the Celery tasks in the Paper Processing Pipeline to coordinate the processing workflow.

Example:

```python
# Initialize adapters
kg_adapter = KnowledgeGraphAdapter(knowledge_graph_manager)
impl_adapter = ResearchImplementationAdapter(implementation_manager)
orchestrator_adapter = ResearchOrchestratorAdapter(orchestrator, plan_generator, content_generator)
extraction_adapter = ExtractionAdapter(document_processor, entity_recognizer, relationship_extractor, knowledge_extractor)

# Use adapters in tasks
async def process_paper(paper_id: str):
    # Fetch the paper
    paper = await paper_model.find_by_id(paper_id)
    
    # Process the paper through the extraction pipeline
    extraction_result = await extraction_adapter.process_paper(paper)
    
    # Update the paper with extracted knowledge
    paper.entities = extraction_result['entities']
    paper.relationships = extraction_result['relationships']
    
    # Save the updated paper
    await paper_model.save(paper)
    
    # Add the paper to the knowledge graph
    kg_result = await kg_adapter.add_paper_to_knowledge_graph(paper)
    paper.knowledge_graph_id = kg_result['paper_node_id']
    
    # Check if the paper is ready for implementation
    if is_implementation_ready(paper):
        paper.implementation_ready = True
        impl_result = await impl_adapter.create_implementation_request(paper)
    
    # Save the final paper state
    await paper_model.save(paper)
```

## Future Work

- **Advanced Integration**: Enhance adapters with more sophisticated integration capabilities
- **Batch Processing**: Add batch operations for improved efficiency
- **Error Handling**: Improve error handling and recovery mechanisms
- **Caching**: Add caching for frequently accessed data
- **Metrics**: Collect performance metrics for monitoring and optimization
