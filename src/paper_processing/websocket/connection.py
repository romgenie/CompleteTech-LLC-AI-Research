"""
WebSocket connection management for the Paper Processing Pipeline.

This module handles WebSocket connections for real-time paper processing
status updates in the Paper Processing Pipeline. It will be implemented
in upcoming sprints as part of Phase 3.5.

Current Implementation Status:
- Connection management structure defined ✓
- Interface with FastAPI defined ✓

Upcoming Development:
- WebSocket server implementation
- Client connection tracking
- Authentication and authorization
- Connection lifecycle management
