# AI Research Implementation System

A comprehensive system for automatically implementing, testing, and validating AI research concepts from scientific papers.

## Overview

The AI Research Implementation System bridges the gap between theoretical AI research and practical implementation. By leveraging advanced AI techniques, the system can extract implementable details from research papers, convert them into working code, design appropriate experiments, and validate results against published claims. This enables researchers to rapidly prototype new ideas and reproduce existing work.

## Key Features

- **Research Paper Understanding**: Extract algorithms, models, and implementation details from papers
- **Automatic Code Generation**: Convert research concepts into executable code across multiple frameworks
- **Experiment Design and Management**: Create and run validation experiments
- **Result Verification**: Compare implementation results with published claims
- **Framework Flexibility**: Support for PyTorch, TensorFlow, JAX, and more
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Thorough validation including ablation studies and robustness tests
- **Error Analysis**: Detailed diagnosis of implementation issues
- **Multi-interface Access**: Web UI, CLI, and Jupyter notebook extensions

## Architecture

The system consists of five core components:

1. **Research Understanding Engine**: Processes AI research papers to extract implementable details
2. **Implementation Planning System**: Creates structured plans for implementing AI techniques
3. **Code Generation Pipeline**: Produces working code implementations of AI methods
4. **Experiment Management Framework**: Designs, runs, and analyzes AI experiments
5. **Research Verification System**: Validates results against published claims and metrics

## Installation & Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/research_implementation.git
cd research_implementation

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure compute resources (optional)
cp config/compute_resources.yaml.example config/compute_resources.yaml
# Edit for your environment

# Configure framework preferences (optional)
cp config/frameworks.yaml.example config/frameworks.yaml
# Edit for your preferred ML frameworks
```

## Usage

### Python API

```python
from research_implementation.core.system import ResearchImplementationSystem

# Initialize the system
system = ResearchImplementationSystem()

# Process a research paper
paper_url = "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13971.pdf"
paper_analysis = system.understand_paper(paper_url)

# Generate implementation plan
impl_plan = system.plan_implementation(
    paper_analysis=paper_analysis,
    target_framework="pytorch",
    complexity_level="standard"  # Options: minimal, standard, complete
)

# Generate code
implementation = system.generate_code(impl_plan)

# Print or save the implementation
print(implementation.get_files())
implementation.save_to_directory("./generated_implementation")

# Create and run experiments
experiment = system.design_experiment(
    implementation=implementation,
    experiment_type="reproduction",  # Options: reproduction, ablation, robustness
    resources={"gpu_count": 1, "max_runtime_hours": 2}
)

# Run the experiment
results = system.run_experiment(experiment)

# Verify against the paper's claims
verification = system.verify_results(
    results=results,
    paper_analysis=paper_analysis
)

# Generate report
report = system.generate_report(
    implementation=implementation,
    experiment=experiment,
    results=results,
    verification=verification
)
```

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Process a paper and generate implementation
research-impl paper2code --paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13971.pdf --framework pytorch --output ./implementation

# Run experiments
research-impl run-experiments --implementation ./implementation --experiment-type reproduction

# Verify results
research-impl verify --results ./results --paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13971.pdf
```

### Web Interface

The system also provides a web interface:

1. Start the web server: `python -m research_implementation.api.server`
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
3. Upload a paper or provide a URL to begin the implementation process
