# High-Level Structural Plan 2: Dynamic Knowledge Graph System for AI Research

## Overview
A system focused on building, maintaining, and leveraging a comprehensive knowledge graph of AI research. This approach emphasizes the integration of KARMA's knowledge extraction capabilities with GDesigner's graph-based agent coordination, TDAG's dynamic task handling, and open_deep_research's information gathering to create a living map of AI research that identifies patterns, trends, and knowledge gaps.

## Core Components
1. **Multi-source Knowledge Extractor** - Processes various information sources to extract structured knowledge
2. **Evolving Knowledge Graph** - Maintains a dynamic, interconnected representation of AI concepts and relationships
3. **Graph-based Agent Network** - Coordinates specialized agents using optimized graph topologies
4. **Insight Generation System** - Discovers patterns, contradictions, and gaps in the knowledge
5. **Research Guidance Interface** - Provides actionable insights and research directions to users

## Key Capabilities
- Automatic construction of AI knowledge graphs from research literature
- Dynamic updating of knowledge as new research emerges
- Detection of emerging trends and declining interest areas
- Identification of contradictions and confirmation across multiple sources
- Generation of novel research questions and hypothesis formulation

## Integration Points
- KARMA for knowledge extraction and graph construction
- GDesigner for graph-based agent communication
- TDAG for dynamic agent generation and task handling
- open_deep_research for comprehensive information gathering
- AutoCodeAgent2.0 for experimental implementation and validation
