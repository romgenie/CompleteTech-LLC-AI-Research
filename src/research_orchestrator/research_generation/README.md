# Research Generation System

The Research Generation System is a core component of the Research Orchestration Framework, responsible for generating well-structured research outputs based on collected information and knowledge.

## Overview

This system transforms extracted knowledge and research findings into coherent, organized research outputs such as papers, reports, surveys, and tutorials. It handles the structure planning, content synthesis, citation management, visualization, and code example generation.

## Components

### Report Structure Planner

The Report Structure Planner is responsible for determining the appropriate structure for research outputs based on their type, audience, and content:

- **Document Type Classification**: Determines appropriate format (paper, review, etc.)
- **Section Organization**: Creates logical section sequence and hierarchy
- **Content Balance Optimization**: Allocates appropriate space to different topics
- **Narrative Flow Design**: Ensures coherent progression of ideas
- **Audience Adaptation**: Adjusts structure based on target audience

#### Key Features

- **Multiple Document Types**: Support for research papers, literature reviews, technical reports, tutorials, and surveys
- **Section Templates**: Predefined templates for common document types
- **Customization**: Ability to customize sections based on topic and audience
- **Section Outlines**: Generation of detailed section outlines
- **Audience Adaptation**: Adjustments for different audiences (academic, industry, beginners)

### Content Synthesis Engine (To Be Implemented)

Will generate coherent text content for each section of the document, integrating extracted knowledge and insights:

- **Concept Explanation**: Clear explanations of technical concepts
- **Research Summaries**: Concise summaries of research areas
- **Comparative Analysis**: Comparisons between methods/approaches
- **Future Direction Projection**: Insights on research trajectories
- **Technical Detail Calibration**: Adjustments for different audiences

### Citation Manager (To Be Implemented)

Will handle proper attribution and citation management throughout the document:

- **Source Attribution**: Ensures proper citation of all information
- **Citation Style Formatting**: Formats references according to specified styles
- **In-text Citation Placement**: Inserts citations at appropriate points in text
- **Reference List Generation**: Creates complete, formatted bibliography
- **Citation Completeness Checking**: Ensures all citations have corresponding references

### Visualization Generator (To Be Implemented)

Will create visual representations of data, concepts, and relationships:

- **Concept Relationship Visualization**: Concept maps and relationship diagrams
- **Performance Comparison Graphing**: Charts comparing method performance
- **Trend Visualization**: Graphs showing research trends over time
- **Architecture Diagrams**: Visual representations of model architectures
- **Algorithm Flowcharts**: Visual representations of algorithms

### Code Implementation Module (To Be Implemented)

Will generate code implementations, examples, and documentation:

- **Algorithm Implementation**: Code implementations of algorithms
- **Framework Adaptation**: Adaptations to specific frameworks
- **Testing Suite Creation**: Tests for implemented code
- **Documentation Writing**: Clear code documentation
- **Usage Example Generation**: Sample code showing implementation usage

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Document Structure

```python
from research_orchestrator.research_generation import ReportStructurePlanner, DocumentType

# Initialize the planner
planner = ReportStructurePlanner()

# Generate a research paper structure
structure = planner.generate_structure(
    title="Advanced Techniques in Transformer-based Natural Language Processing",
    document_type=DocumentType.RESEARCH_PAPER,
    topic="Transformer architectures for NLP",
    audience="Academic"
)

# Save the structure
structure.save_to_file("paper_structure.json")
```

### Analyzing Topics for Sections

```python
# Suggest sections based on topic and subtopics
subtopics = [
    "Attention Mechanisms",
    "Positional Encoding",
    "Transformer Pre-training",
    "Fine-tuning Strategies"
]

sections = planner.analyze_topics_for_sections(
    topic="Transformer Architecture Improvements",
    subtopics=subtopics,
    document_type=DocumentType.RESEARCH_PAPER
)

# Add suggested sections to structure
for section in sections:
    structure.add_section(section)
```

### Adapting for Different Audiences

```python
# Adjust structure for industry audience
industry_structure = planner.adjust_for_audience(
    structure=structure,
    audience="Industry"
)

# Generate section outlines
for section in industry_structure.sections:
    outline = planner.generate_section_outline(
        section=section,
        topic="Transformer Architecture Improvements"
    )
    print(f"Outline for {section.title}:")
    print(outline)
```

## Integration with Other Components

This Research Generation System integrates with:

1. **Knowledge Extraction Pipeline**: Sources information and knowledge to include in generated content
2. **Graph-based Knowledge Integration**: Utilizes the knowledge graph for insights, relationships, and connections
3. **Research Implementation System**: Incorporates code implementations and examples
4. **Research Planning Coordinator**: Aligns generated content with the overall research plan and objectives

## Extension Points

The system is designed to be extensible:

1. **Custom Document Types**: Add new document types by creating new templates
2. **Custom Section Types**: Extend the section types for specialized document formats
3. **Style Guide Integration**: Add support for additional formatting and style guides
4. **LLM Integration**: Enhance with large language models for more sophisticated content generation
5. **Visualization Libraries**: Add support for different visualization libraries and formats
