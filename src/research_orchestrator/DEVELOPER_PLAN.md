   - Build visualization generation tools
   - Implement code example generation

### Phase 4: Integration, Testing, and Refinement (Weeks 10-12)

1. **System Integration**
   - Connect all modules through the orchestrator
   - Implement end-to-end workflows
   - Create API interfaces for external access
   - Develop UI for system interaction

2. **Testing and Refinement**
   - Develop comprehensive test suite
   - Perform end-to-end testing with real queries
   - Benchmark system performance
   - Refine based on test results

## Integration Priorities

### External Repository Integration

1. **TDAG Integration** (Highest Priority)
   - Focus on task decomposition mechanisms
   - Integrate planning capabilities

2. **open_deep_research Integration** (High Priority)
   - Leverage comprehensive information gathering
   - Adapt research planning components

3. **KARMA Integration** (High Priority)
   - Integrate knowledge extraction capabilities
   - Adapt knowledge graph construction

4. **GDesigner Integration** (Medium Priority)
   - Implement graph-based agent communication
   - Adapt agent coordination patterns

5. **AutoCodeAgent2.0 Integration** (Medium Priority)
   - Integrate code generation capabilities
   - Adapt implementation verification mechanisms

## Technical Decisions

### Programming Language and Framework
- Python 3.9+ as primary language
- FastAPI for API development
- React for web interface (if applicable)

### Data Storage
- MongoDB for document storage and project state
- Neo4j for knowledge graph (optional, depending on scale)
- Redis for caching and job queues

### Model Integration
- OpenAI API for GPT models
- Hugging Face for open-source models
- Support for local model deployment with LangServe

### Deployment
- Docker containers for all components
- Kubernetes for orchestration in production
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

## Coding Standards

1. **Code Style**
   - Follow PEP 8 standards for Python code
   - Use Google Python Style Guide for docstrings
   - Use type hints throughout the codebase

2. **Testing**
   - Maintain 80%+ code coverage
   - Write unit tests for all components
   - Create integration tests for module interactions
   - Implement end-to-end tests for critical workflows

3. **Documentation**
   - Document all public APIs with docstrings
   - Create architecture documentation with diagrams
   - Write developer guides for each module
   - Document integration points with external systems

## Collaboration Workflow

1. **Version Control**
   - Use Git for version control
   - Follow GitHub Flow branching model
   - Use conventional commits for commit messages

2. **Code Review**
   - All code changes require pull requests
   - Require at least one reviewer approval
   - Enforce passing tests before merging

3. **Issue Tracking**
   - Use GitHub Issues for task management
   - Organize work with project boards
   - Tag issues with appropriate labels

## Risk Management

1. **Technical Risks**
   - API rate limits and quotas for external services
   - Model availability and performance
   - Integration compatibility issues

2. **Mitigation Strategies**
   - Implement robust error handling and fallbacks
   - Create cached/offline modes for development
   - Design adapter interfaces for abstraction
   - Regular integration testing with external systems
