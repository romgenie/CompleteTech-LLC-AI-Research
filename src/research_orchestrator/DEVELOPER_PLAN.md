# Research Orchestration Framework - Developer Plan

## Overview

The Research Orchestration Framework is designed to coordinate the entire research process from query to report generation. This plan outlines the development approach, architecture, and integration with the Paper Processing Pipeline.

## Core Components

### Research Planning

- **QueryAnalyzer**: Analyzes research queries
- **ResearchPlanGenerator**: Generates research plans
- **ResourceAllocator**: Allocates resources for research tasks

### Information Gathering

- **SourceManager**: Manages information sources
- **SearchManager**: Coordinates search operations
- **QualityAssessor**: Evaluates information quality

### Knowledge Extraction

- **DocumentProcessor**: Processes documents in various formats
- **EntityRecognizer**: Identifies entities in content
- **RelationshipExtractor**: Identifies relationships between entities
- **KnowledgeExtractor**: Coordinates extraction process

### Knowledge Integration

- **KnowledgeGraphAdapter**: Interfaces with Knowledge Graph
- **ConflictResolver**: Resolves conflicting information
- **ConnectionDiscovery**: Finds connections between concepts

### Research Generation

- **ReportStructure**: Plans report structure
- **ContentSynthesis**: Generates report content
- **CitationManager**: Manages citations

### Core Framework

- **Orchestrator**: Main coordinator for the research process
- **StateManager**: Manages research state
- **TDAG Adapter**: Interfaces with TDAG for task decomposition

## Development Approach

1. **Phase 1**: Core framework and research planning
   - Orchestrator and state management
   - Query analysis and plan generation
   - TDAG integration for task decomposition

2. **Phase 2**: Information gathering and knowledge extraction
   - Source management and search coordination
   - Document processing and entity recognition
   - Knowledge graph integration

3. **Phase 3**: Research generation and advanced features
   - Report structure planning
   - Content synthesis
   - Citation management

4. **Phase 3.5**: Paper Processing Integration
   - Connect with Paper Processing Pipeline
   - Add research workflow from paper uploads
   - Implement automatic research report generation from papers

## Technical Decisions

1. **Modular Architecture**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Well-defined interfaces between components
   - Adapter pattern for external integrations

2. **State Management**
   - Transaction-based state changes
   - Persistence across process restarts
   - Comprehensive history tracking

3. **Extensibility**
   - Plugin system for new sources
   - Configurable workflows
   - Customizable report templates

## Integration with Paper Processing Pipeline

### Current State
Currently, the Research Orchestration Framework can work with papers manually, but lacks automated integration with the paper upload process. The paper upload functionality exists, but papers remain in the "uploaded" status without automatic processing.

### Future Integration (Phase 3.5)

1. **Research Workflow for Uploaded Papers**:
   - Create specialized workflow for processing uploaded papers
   - Integrate with paper status transitions
   - Implement comprehensive paper analysis pipeline
   - Generate research reports based on paper analysis

2. **Orchestration of Paper Processing Tasks**:
   - Coordinate parallel processing tasks for efficiency
   - Implement task prioritization for batch paper processing
   - Manage resource allocation for processing intensive papers
   - Build retry and recovery mechanisms for failed processing

3. **Extraction Management**:
   - Coordinate entity and relationship extraction
   - Integrate multiple extraction techniques
   - Implement confidence scoring and verification
   - Handle specialized extractions for different paper types

4. **Knowledge Integration from Papers**:
   - Combine knowledge across multiple papers
   - Resolve conflicts between paper findings
   - Track knowledge provenance to source papers
   - Build cumulative knowledge bases from papers

5. **Research Report Generation from Papers**:
   - Generate specialized research reports from processed papers
   - Implement paper summarization at various detail levels
   - Create comparative reports across multiple papers
   - Design specialized visualizations for paper findings

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests** for individual components
   - Test each component in isolation
   - Mock dependencies for controlled testing

2. **Integration Tests** for component interactions
   - Test workflows end-to-end
   - Verify correct data flow between components

3. **System Tests** for full research process
   - Test with real research queries
   - Test with real research papers
   - Verify research outputs

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Month 1**: Core framework and research planning
2. **Month 2**: Information gathering and knowledge extraction
3. **Month 3**: Research generation and integration
4. **Month 4+**: Paper Processing Integration (Phase 3.5)

## Dependencies

- **External**: TDAG, open_deep_research, KARMA
- **Internal**: Knowledge Graph System, Research Implementation

## Risk Assessment

1. **Integration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Clear interfaces, adapter pattern, comprehensive testing

2. **Process Scalability**
   - Mitigation: Asynchronous processing, task queues, resource management

3. **Content Quality**
   - Mitigation: Multiple sources, verification, human reviewable outputs

4. **System Resilience**
   - Mitigation: State persistence, retry mechanisms, graceful degradation

This plan adheres to the project architecture and implementation priorities outlined in CODING_PROMPT.md, with special attention to the integration with the Paper Processing Pipeline planned for Phase 3.5.
