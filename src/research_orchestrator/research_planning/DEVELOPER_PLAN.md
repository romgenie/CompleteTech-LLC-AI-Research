# Developer Plan: Research Planning Module

This document outlines the development plan for the Research Planning module of the AI Research Orchestration Framework.

## Implementation Priority

**Phase 1 Priority**: High (Weeks 1-3)

The Research Planning module is a critical early component as it defines the scope and structure of the research workflow.

## Development Tasks

### 1. Query Analysis (Week 1)

- [ ] Implement natural language query parser
- [ ] Create research scope determination system
- [ ] Build topic classification functionality
- [ ] Develop technical complexity assessment

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Can extract key topics, constraints, and objectives from freeform queries
- Accurately classifies research queries by domain and complexity
- Determines appropriate scope and depth for research

### 2. Research Plan Generation (Week 2)

- [ ] Implement plan structure generation
- [ ] Build section and subsection creation logic
- [ ] Develop research objective formulation
- [ ] Create timeline estimation functionality

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Generates well-structured research plans with logical organization
- Creates appropriate sections based on query domain and complexity
- Formulates clear, specific research objectives
- Provides realistic timeline estimates

### 3. Feedback Integration (Week 2-3)

- [ ] Implement user feedback parsing
- [ ] Build plan revision logic
- [ ] Create interactive clarification system
- [ ] Develop explanation generation for plan decisions

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Successfully incorporates feedback to improve research plans
- Can handle contradictory or conflicting feedback
- Provides explanations for plan structure decisions
- Maintains plan coherence during revisions

### 4. Resource Allocation (Week 3)

- [ ] Implement computation cost estimation
- [ ] Build model selection optimization
- [ ] Create API rate limit management
- [ ] Develop parallel task scheduling

#### Acceptance Criteria
- Accurately estimates computational needs for research tasks
- Selects appropriate models based on task requirements
- Respects API rate limits and quotas
- Effectively schedules concurrent execution where possible

## Integration Requirements

### TDAG Integration

- Primary integration point for task decomposition
- Use TDAG's planning capabilities for research plan generation
- Leverage its agent generation for specialized research tasks

#### Integration Tasks
- [ ] Create TDAG adapter interface
- [ ] Map query analysis to TDAG input format
- [ ] Transform TDAG output to research plan format
- [ ] Implement fallback mechanisms for when TDAG is unavailable

## Technical Specifications

### Data Models

```python
class QueryAnalysis:
    topics: List[str]
    constraints: Dict[str, Any]
    objectives: List[str]
    complexity: str  # "basic", "standard", "advanced"
    domain: str  # "ai", "ml", "nlp", etc.

class ResearchPlan:
    title: str
    sections: List[Section]
    estimated_time: int  # in minutes
    complexity: str
    focus_areas: List[str]

class Section:
    title: str
    description: str
    subsections: List[Subsection]
    objectives: List[str]

class Subsection:
    title: str
    description: str
    search_queries: List[str]
    expected_sources: int
```

### API Endpoints

```
POST /api/research-planning/analyze-query
POST /api/research-planning/generate-plan
PUT /api/research-planning/revise-plan
GET /api/research-planning/plans/{plan_id}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- Query analyzer tests with various query types
- Plan generator tests with different domains and complexities
- Feedback integrator tests with various feedback scenarios
- Resource allocator tests with different computational profiles

### Integration Tests

- End-to-end tests from query to completed plan
- TDAG integration tests
- Module interaction tests with Information Gathering

## Dependencies

- LangChain for NLP processing
- TDAG adapter for task decomposition
- scikit-learn for topic classification (optional)
- SPARQLWrapper for domain-specific knowledge (optional)

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Query misinterpretation | Incorrect research direction | Human-in-the-loop verification for critical queries |
| Plan coherence issues | Disorganized research | Template-based approach with customization |
| Unrealistic timeline estimates | User dissatisfaction | Conservative estimates with buffer times |
| TDAG integration failure | Reduced plan quality | Fallback to template-based planning |
