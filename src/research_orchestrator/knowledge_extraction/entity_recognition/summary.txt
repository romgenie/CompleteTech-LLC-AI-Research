# Entity Recognition System Implementation Summary

## Components Implemented

1. **Entity Data Model (`entity.py`)**
   - Defined the `Entity` class for representing extracted entities
   - Created the `EntityType` enum for categorizing different types of entities
   - Implemented methods for serialization, comparison, and position handling

2. **Base Recognizer (`base_recognizer.py`)**
   - Created the abstract `EntityRecognizer` base class
   - Implemented common functionality for filtering, merging, and grouping entities
   - Added methods for saving/loading entities and computing statistics

3. **AI Entity Recognizer (`ai_recognizer.py`)**
   - Implemented recognizer for AI-specific entities (models, datasets, metrics, etc.)
   - Created pattern-based and dictionary-based recognition
   - Added contextual analysis for related entities
   - Implemented confidence scoring based on multiple factors

4. **Scientific Entity Recognizer (`scientific_recognizer.py`)**
   - Implemented recognizer for scientific concepts (theories, findings, methodologies)
   - Created pattern-based recognition with capture groups
   - Added citation and reference detection
   - Implemented confidence scoring for scientific entities

5. **Combined Entity Recognizer (`combined_recognizer.py`)**
   - Created a combined recognizer that integrates multiple specialized recognizers
   - Implemented intelligent conflict resolution
   - Added entity prioritization based on type and confidence
   - Provided methods for retrieving specific recognizer instances

6. **Factory (`factory.py`)**
   - Implemented the `EntityRecognizerFactory` for creating recognizer instances
   - Added support for configuration-based initialization
   - Created methods for loading from configuration files
   - Added convenience methods for creating default recognizers

7. **Test Example (`test_example.py`)**
   - Created an example script demonstrating the entity recognition system
   - Implemented examples for AI, scientific, and combined recognition
   - Added pretty printing for entity output

## Features Implemented

- **Comprehensive Entity Type System**: 20+ entity types for AI and scientific domains
- **Pattern-Based Recognition**: Regular expression patterns for different entity types
- **Dictionary-Based Recognition**: Lookup-based recognition for known terms
- **Contextual Recognition**: Using document context to improve entity identification
- **Confidence Scoring**: Heuristic-based confidence scoring for entities
- **Entity Merging**: Intelligent handling of overlapping and conflicting entities
- **Configuration System**: Flexible configuration through dictionaries or files
- **Serialization**: JSON serialization for entities and configurations
- **Statistics Generation**: Computing statistics on recognized entities

## Next Steps

1. **Relationship Extraction Module**:
   - Implement the relationship data model
   - Create base relationship extractor
   - Develop specialized extractors for different relationship types
   - Integrate with entity recognition

2. **Knowledge Extraction Coordinator**:
   - Create the coordinator for the overall extraction process
   - Implement knowledge structure representation
   - Add integration with document processing and knowledge graph
   
3. **Optimization and Testing**:
   - Add more comprehensive test cases
   - Optimize for performance on large documents
   - Add support for batch processing
   - Implement more advanced confidence scoring algorithms
