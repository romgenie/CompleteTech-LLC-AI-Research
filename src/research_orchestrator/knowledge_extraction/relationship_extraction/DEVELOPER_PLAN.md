# Relationship Extraction Module - Developer Plan

## Overview

The Relationship Extraction module is responsible for identifying and extracting relationships between entities in research documents. It's a critical component of the Knowledge Extraction Pipeline that transforms entity information into a connected knowledge graph.

## Component Structure

The Relationship Extraction module consists of the following components:

1. **Relationship Data Model**:
   - Represents relationships between entities
   - Provides serialization and utility methods
   - Supports confidence scoring and metadata

2. **Base Relationship Extractor**:
   - Abstract base class for all relationship extractors
   - Common functionality for relationship handling
   - Utility methods for entity pair analysis

3. **Pattern-based Extractor**:
   - Extracts relationships using regex patterns
   - Configurable for different relationship types
   - Context-aware extraction with confidence scoring

4. **AI-specific Extractor**:
   - Specialized for AI research relationships
   - Extracts model performance, architecture relationships
   - Expert knowledge of AI entity relationships

5. **Combined Extractor**:
   - Integrates multiple specialized extractors
   - Resolves conflicts between different extractors
   - Provides comprehensive relationship analysis

6. **Extractor Factory**:
   - Creates and configures different types of extractors
   - Supports creation from configuration files
   - Provides default configurations for common use cases

## Integration Points

1. **Entity Recognition Integration**:
   - Uses entities from Entity Recognition System as input
   - Entity types guide relationship identification
   - Entity confidence affects relationship confidence

2. **Document Processing Integration**:
   - Processes document text after document processing
   - Extracts relationships within the document context
   - Uses document structure for context boundaries

3. **Knowledge Graph Integration**:
   - Extracted relationships form edges in the knowledge graph
   - Relationship types define edge types in the graph
   - Relationship confidence informs graph edge weights

## Usage Patterns

1. **Basic Relationship Extraction**:
   ```python
   # Create an extractor
   extractor = RelationshipExtractorFactory.create_default_extractor()
   
   # Extract relationships from text and entities
   relationships = extractor.extract_relationships(text, entities)
   
   # Filter relationships
   high_confidence = extractor.filter_relationships(
       relationships, min_confidence=0.8
   )
   ```

2. **Custom Pattern Definition**:
   ```python
   # Create a pattern extractor
   pattern_extractor = RelationshipExtractorFactory.create_pattern_extractor()
   
   # Add custom patterns
   pattern_extractor.add_pattern(
       RelationType.APPLIED_TO,
       r"\{source\} is used for \{target\}"
   )
   ```

3. **AI-specific Analysis**:
   ```python
   # Create an AI extractor
   ai_extractor = RelationshipExtractorFactory.create_ai_extractor()
   
   # Extract and analyze
   relationships = ai_extractor.extract_relationships(text, entities)
   
   # Get model performance information
   model_performance = ai_extractor.extract_model_performance(relationships)
   
   # Get model hierarchy
   model_hierarchy = ai_extractor.extract_model_hierarchy(relationships)
   ```

## Technical Decisions

1. **Pattern Matching Approach**:
   - Regular expression patterns with entity placeholders
   - Entity-specific pattern matching based on entity types
   - Context window analysis for confidence scoring

2. **Conflict Resolution Strategy**:
   - Relationship type priorities for common conflicts
   - Compatibility matrix for relationships that can coexist
   - Confidence-based selection for ambiguous cases

3. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Entity pair filtering to reduce pattern matching load
   - Context window limiting for efficient text analysis
   - Caching of text spans and context for repeated analysis

## Future Enhancements

1. **Scientific Relationship Extractor**:
   - Specialized extractor for scientific citations and references
   - Academic relationship patterns (cites, builds-upon, confirms, contradicts)
   - Domain-specific relationship detection

2. **Machine Learning Approaches**:
   - Statistical relationship extraction based on training data
   - Supervised classification of relationship types
   - Feature-based confidence scoring

3. **Interactive Relationship Refinement**:
   - User feedback integration for relationship accuracy
   - Confidence adjustment based on manual verification
   - Pattern learning from user corrections

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Parallel relationship extraction for large documents
   - Pre-compiled pattern optimization
   - Entity proximity index for faster pair finding

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**:
   - Tests for each extractor type
   - Pattern matching validation
   - Relationship merging and conflict resolution

2. **Integration Tests**:
   - Full pipeline testing with entity recognition
   - Cross-component interaction validation
   - End-to-end extraction workflow testing

3. **Performance Tests**:
   - Benchmark extraction speed on large documents
   - Memory usage profiling
   - Optimization validation
