   - Created the `RelationType` enum with 30+ relationship types
   - Implemented methods for serialization, validation, and utility functions
   - Added relationship inversion capability for bidirectional relationships

2. **Base Relationship Extractor (`base_extractor.py`)**
   - Created the abstract `RelationshipExtractor` base class
   - Implemented common functionality for filtering, grouping, and managing relationships
   - Added entity pair finding and context extraction utilities
   - Implemented relationship chain and path finding capabilities

3. **Pattern-based Extractor (`pattern_extractor.py`)**
   - Implemented regex pattern-based relationship extraction
   - Created entity type association with relationship types
   - Implemented context-aware confidence scoring
   - Added customizable pattern handling

4. **AI-specific Extractor (`ai_extractor.py`)**
   - Implemented specialized extraction for AI research relationships
   - Created performance relationship extraction (model metrics)
   - Added architecture and dataset relationship detection
   - Implemented model hierarchy and implementation relationship detection

5. **Combined Extractor (`combined_extractor.py`)**
   - Created extractor that integrates multiple specialized extractors
   - Implemented conflict resolution strategies for relationships
   - Added relationship type prioritization system
   - Implemented relationship network analysis utilities

6. **Extractor Factory (`factory.py`)**
   - Implemented factory methods for different extractor types
   - Created configuration-based creation system
   - Added default extractor configurations
   - Implemented sub-extractor handling for combined extractor

7. **Test Example (`test_example.py`)**
   - Created example script demonstrating the relationship extraction system
   - Implemented examples for pattern-based, AI-specific, and combined extraction
   - Added filtering and statistics generation examples

## Features Implemented

- **Comprehensive Relationship Types**: 30+ relationship types for AI and scientific domains
- **Pattern-Based Extraction**: Regular expression patterns with entity placeholder substitution
- **Entity Type Association**: Intelligent matching of entity types with relationship types
- **Context Analysis**: Extract and analyze surrounding context for relationship verification
