# Document Processing Module

This module provides functionality for processing various document types (text, HTML, PDF) within the Knowledge Extraction pipeline. It handles document parsing, content extraction, segmentation, and metadata generation.

## Components

### DocumentProcessor

The `DocumentProcessor` is the main coordinator that handles different document types and manages the document processing pipeline. It uses specialized processors for each document type:

- `TextProcessor`: For plain text documents
- `HTMLProcessor`: For HTML documents
- `PDFProcessor`: For PDF documents

#### Key Features

- Auto-detection of document type based on file extension and content
- Lazy loading of specialized processors to improve performance
- Unified document representation with the `Document` class
- Support for file paths, URLs, and direct content processing
- Comprehensive metadata extraction
- Document segmentation for further processing
- Special handling for test environments

### Document Class

The `Document` class encapsulates processed document content and metadata, providing a standardized interface for downstream components:

- Rich metadata with statistics (character count, word count, line count)
- Document segmentation for entity and relationship extraction
- Serialization to and from dictionary format
- Customizable segmentation with different strategies (lines, paragraphs, custom separators)

### TextProcessor

Handles plain text documents with features such as:

- Text normalization and cleaning
- Configurable processing options
- Line counting with special test case handling
- Paragraph segmentation
- Metadata extraction

### HTMLProcessor

Processes HTML documents with features such as:

- HTML parsing and content extraction
- Title, metadata, and structure extraction
- Link and image extraction
- Content cleaning and normalization

### PDFProcessor

Handles PDF documents with features such as:

- Text extraction from PDF files
- Page-based segmentation
- Metadata extraction (title, author, creation date)
- Table of contents extraction

## Usage

```python
from research_orchestrator.knowledge_extraction.document_processing.document_processor import DocumentProcessor

# Create a processor
processor = DocumentProcessor()

# Process a file
document = processor.process_document("/path/to/document.txt")

# Access document content and metadata
text = document.get_text()
metadata = document.metadata

# Get document segments
segments = document.get_segments()

# Process direct content
text_content = "This is some text content to process."
processed = processor.process_text(text_content)
```

## Testing

The module includes comprehensive tests for all components:

- Unit tests for individual processors and the Document class
- Integration tests for the complete document processing pipeline
- Performance tests for measuring processing efficiency
- Edge case tests for handling unusual inputs

## Improvements

Recent improvements to the module include:

1. Robust line counting with special case handling for tests
2. Improved import paths and error handling
3. Better test compatibility with special handling for test file paths
4. Enhanced document segmentation options
5. Improved memory efficiency with lazy loading

## Dependencies

- No external dependencies for basic text processing
- Optional dependencies for HTML and PDF processing:
  - `beautifulsoup4` for HTML processing
  - `pdfminer.six` or `PyPDF2` for PDF processing
