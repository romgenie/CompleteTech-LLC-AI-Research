# Knowledge Extraction - Developer Plan

## Overview

The Knowledge Extraction module is responsible for extracting structured knowledge from research documents. This plan outlines the development approach, component architecture, and future enhancements.

## Core Components

### Document Processing Engine

- **DocumentProcessor**: Coordinates processing of different document types
- **PDFProcessor**: For PDF documents using PyPDF2
- **HTMLProcessor**: For HTML documents using BeautifulSoup
- **TextProcessor**: For plain text documents

### Entity Recognition System

- **EntityRecognizer**: Abstract base class for entity recognizers
- **AIEntityRecognizer**: For AI-specific entities
- **ScientificEntityRecognizer**: For scientific concepts
- **CombinedEntityRecognizer**: Integration of multiple recognizers
- **EntityRecognizerFactory**: Factory pattern for creating recognizers

### Relationship Extraction Module

- **RelationshipExtractor**: Abstract base class for extractors
- **PatternRelationshipExtractor**: Pattern-based extraction
- **AIRelationshipExtractor**: Specialized for AI research
- **CombinedRelationshipExtractor**: Integration of multiple extractors
- **RelationshipExtractorFactory**: Factory pattern for creating extractors

### Knowledge Extraction Coordinator

- **KnowledgeExtractor**: Main coordinator for extraction pipeline
- **ExtractionResult**: Data model for extraction results
- **GraphBuilder**: For creating knowledge graphs from results

## Development Approach

1. **Phase 1**: Core interfaces and base classes
   - Define abstract base classes
   - Create data models
   - Design interfaces between components

2. **Phase 2**: Implementation of specific components
   - Document processors for different formats
   - Entity recognizers for different domains
   - Relationship extractors for different methods

3. **Phase 3**: Integration and coordination
   - Knowledge Extractor implementation
   - Component integration
   - Result management and serialization

4. **Phase 3.5**: Paper Processing Pipeline (Future)
   - Paper Lifecycle Management with state transitions
   - Asynchronous Processing Architecture with Celery
   - API Endpoints for manual and batch processing
   - Knowledge Graph integration for extracted concepts
   - Implementation System integration for code generation

## Technical Decisions

1. **Modular Design** for extensibility
   - Abstract base classes with clear interfaces
   - Factory pattern for component creation
   - Adapter pattern for external integrations

2. **Processing Pipeline Architecture**
   - Sequential processing with clear stages
   - Configurable pipeline components
   - Fallback mechanisms for robustness

3. **Entity and Relationship Type System**
   - Hierarchical organization
   - Domain-specific extensions
   - Clear categorization and relation definitions

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests** for individual components
   - Test each processor, recognizer, and extractor
   - Mock dependencies for isolated testing

2. **Integration Tests** for component interactions
   - Test pipeline with multiple components
   - Verify correct data flow between stages

3. **End-to-End Tests** for full extraction process
   - Test with real documents
   - Verify extraction results against expected outcomes

## Future Enhancements

### Paper Processing Pipeline

1. **Asynchronous Processing Architecture**
   - Create Celery-based task management system
   - Configure auto-retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
   - Set up dead letter queues for failed tasks
   - Implement health monitoring and logging

2. **Paper Lifecycle Management**
   - Implement comprehensive state machine
   - Design granular state transitions
   - Create state management service with error handling
   - Track processing history with timestamps

3. **Processing Integration**
   - Connect with existing document processors
   - Utilize knowledge extraction pipeline
   - Integrate with knowledge graph system
   - Link with implementation generation

4. **API and Interface Enhancements**
   - Create comprehensive processing endpoints
   - Build real-time communication system
   - Implement search, filtering, and organization

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Month 1**: Core interfaces and document processing
2. **Month 2**: Entity and relationship extraction
3. **Month 3**: Knowledge extraction coordinator and integration
4. **Month 4+**: Paper processing pipeline (Future Phase 3.5)

## Dependencies

- **External**: PyPDF2, BeautifulSoup, NLTK, spaCy
- **Internal**: Knowledge Graph System, Research Orchestrator Core

## Risk Assessment

1. **Document Format Compatibility**
   - Mitigation: Support most common formats, implement fallbacks

2. **Extraction Accuracy**
   - Mitigation: Combined extractors, confidence scoring, human verification

3. **Scalability for Large Papers**
   - Mitigation: Implement chunking, optimize memory usage

4. **Processing Performance**
   - Mitigation: Asynchronous processing, caching

This plan is aligned with the overall project architecture and coding standards outlined in CODING_PROMPT.md.
