# Knowledge Extraction Component - Developer Plan

## Overview

The Knowledge Extraction component is responsible for extracting structured information from research documents, including identifying entities, relationships, and key concepts. It's a critical part of the Research Orchestration Framework that transforms unstructured document content into knowledge that can be used by other components.

## Component Structure

The Knowledge Extraction component consists of the following subcomponents:

1. **Document Processing Engine**:
   - Responsible for processing different types of documents (PDF, HTML, plaintext)
   - Extracts and preprocesses content for further analysis
   
2. **Entity Recognition System**:
   - ✅ Identifies entities such as models, datasets, algorithms, etc.
   - ✅ Provides specialized recognizers for AI and scientific entities
   - ✅ Supports confidence scoring and entity filtering
   
3. **Relationship Extraction Module**:
   - Identifies relationships between entities (e.g., "model X was trained on dataset Y")
   - Extracts semantic triples (subject-predicate-object)
   - Supports pattern-based and heuristic-based extraction
   
4. **Knowledge Extraction Coordinator**:
   - Orchestrates the overall extraction process
   - Combines entities and relationships into a coherent knowledge structure
   - Provides interfaces for downstream components
