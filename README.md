# AI Research Integration Project

This project aims to integrate capabilities from several advanced AI research repositories to create a comprehensive system for AI research discovery, knowledge extraction, and implementation.

> Total duration (wall): 1h 52m 8.9s  

## Project Overview

The AI Research Integration Project consists of three main systems:

1. **Research Orchestration Framework**: An end-to-end research assistant that coordinates the entire research process from query to report generation
2. **Dynamic Knowledge Graph System**: A system for building and maintaining knowledge graphs of AI research to identify patterns, trends, and gaps
3. **AI Research Implementation System**: A system that automatically implements, tests, and validates AI research concepts from papers

## Current Implementation Status

### Completed Components

1. **TDAG Adapter**
   - Created adapter interface for the TDAG framework
   - Implemented task decomposition functionality
   - Integrated planning capabilities with the Research Orchestration Framework

2. **Information Gathering Module**
   - Implemented SearchManager for coordinating search operations
   - Created SourceManager for managing different information sources
   - Developed QualityAssessor for evaluating search result quality
   - Implemented specialized source adapters:
     - AcademicSource: For academic databases (ArXiv, PubMed, Semantic Scholar)
     - WebSource: For web search engines (Serper, SerpAPI, Tavily, Perplexity)
     - CodeSource: For code repositories (GitHub, GitLab, Hugging Face, PyPI)
     - AISource: For LLM-generated information (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, local models)

### Next Implementation Priorities

1. **Knowledge Extraction Pipeline**
2. **Graph-based Knowledge Integration**
3. **Research Generation System**

## Technology Stack

- Python 3.9+ for core development
- Neo4j for knowledge graph storage
- FastAPI for API development
- Docker and Docker Compose for containerization

## Architecture Design

The project follows a modular architecture with well-defined interfaces between components. Each system is designed to work both independently and as part of an integrated whole. The adapter pattern is used for all external repository integrations to ensure loose coupling.

## Getting Started

1. Explore the documentation in CLAUDE.md and the plan/ directory
2. Install dependencies from requirements.txt
3. Configure environment variables using .env (based on .env.example)
4. Run tests to verify the installation

## Development Guidelines

- PEP 8 compliant Python code
- Comprehensive type hints
- Google style docstrings
- 80%+ test coverage for all components
