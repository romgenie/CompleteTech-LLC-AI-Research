1. **API Layer**: FastAPI-based RESTful API with JWT authentication, Pydantic models, and comprehensive error handling
2. **Knowledge Graph System**: Neo4j-based graph database with customized schema for AI research entities, temporal versioning, and advanced query optimization
3. **Research Orchestration Engine**: Multi-agent framework coordinating search operations, knowledge extraction, and content generation with configurable pipelines
4. **Implementation Planning System**: Task decomposition engine for converting research papers to code implementations with automated testing and validation
5. **Frontend Layer**: React/TypeScript UI with D3.js visualizations, hierarchical tagging, and collaborative features
6. **Asynchronous Processing**: Celery/Redis task queue system with error handling, retry mechanisms, and dead letter queues for robust paper processing

## Getting Started

### Running with Docker

The easiest way to get started is using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-research-integration.git
cd ai-research-integration

# Start all services
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start:
- The landing page at http://localhost:3000
- The API at http://localhost:8000
- Neo4j database at bolt://localhost:7687 (Web UI: http://localhost:7474)
- MongoDB at mongodb://localhost:27017

### API Documentation

Once the services are running, you can access the API documentation at:
- http://localhost:3000/api/docs (Swagger UI)
- http://localhost:3000/api/redoc (ReDoc)

## Theme and Design System

The platform follows a consistent design system documented in [THEME.md](THEME.md). The design system includes:

- Color palette with primary, secondary, and accent colors
- Typography guidelines
- UI component styling
- Accessibility considerations

All new components and pages should adhere to this design system for a consistent user experience.

## Development

### API Development

The API is built with FastAPI. To run the API in development mode:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-api.txt

# Run the API with auto-reload
uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Frontend Development

The landing page is built with Express.js:

```bash
# Navigate to the landing page directory
cd src/ui/landing

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### Running Tests

The project has a comprehensive test suite. To run the tests:

```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install -r requirements-test.txt

# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run specific test modules
python -m pytest tests/research_orchestrator/knowledge_extraction/

# Run with coverage report
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=xml
```

## Inspiration Sources

This project draws inspiration from five specialized AI agent frameworks:

### 1. [AutoCodeAgent2.0](https://github.com/romgenie/AutoCodeAgent2.0)
A dual-mode AI agent framework with IntelliChain for code generation and Deep Search for autonomous web research. Our implementation planning system leverages AutoCodeAgent2.0's task decomposition, code validation, and execution workflow, while our research generation system adopts its multi-agent collaborative chain for research synthesis.

### 2. [TDAG (Task Decomposition Agent Generation)](https://github.com/romgenie/TDAG)
A hierarchical multi-agent system for complex problem-solving with dynamic task decomposition. Our research orchestration framework is built on TDAG's coordination principles, using specialized agents that communicate through standardized interfaces and a shared state management system.

### 3. [GDesigner](https://github.com/romgenie/GDesigner)
A graph-based multi-agent system supporting various topologies for agent communication. Our knowledge integration modules use GDesigner's principles for connecting specialized knowledge workers in configurable patterns, with agent coordination and dynamic edge pruning based on importance scores.

### 4. [KARMA](https://github.com/romgenie/KARMA)
A framework for automated knowledge graph enrichment using specialized LLM agents to extract scientific knowledge. Our knowledge extraction pipeline adopts KARMA's multi-dimensional scoring system for evaluating extracted information, and its approach to handling document processing and conflict resolution.

### 5. [AgentLaboratory](https://github.com/SamuelSchmidgall/AgentLaboratory)
An experimental platform for designing, testing, and benchmarking multi-agent systems in controlled environments. Our testing framework and agent evaluation metrics were influenced by AgentLaboratory's approach to systematic performance assessment and behavior analysis. Its agent interaction protocols informed our collaboration features for research teams.
