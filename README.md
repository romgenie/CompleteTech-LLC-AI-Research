Implementation of the research paper "Can LLMs Generate Novel Research Ideas? A Large-Scale Human Study with 100+ NLP Researchers" (Si et al., 2024).

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
## Project Overview

This project aims to evaluate the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating novel, expert-level research ideas in the field of NLP. The system includes:

1. An LLM ideation agent that generates and ranks research ideas
2. A style normalization module for standardizing AI and human-written ideas
3. A comprehensive evaluation framework with human expert reviews
4. Statistical analysis tools for comparing idea quality across conditions

## Key Findings

The paper's central finding is that AI-generated ideas are rated as significantly more novel than human expert ideas, while being comparable or slightly weaker on feasibility metrics. This system allows for:

- Generating diverse research ideas across multiple NLP topics
- Evaluating idea quality through expert review
- Analyzing various dimensions of idea quality (novelty, excitement, feasibility, effectiveness)

## Our Implementation

We've implemented a full-featured research idea generation system in the `ai_research_agent/` directory. Key components include:

1. **Paper Retriever**: Fetches relevant papers from Semantic Scholar API for context
2. **Idea Generator**: Creates novel research ideas based on retrieved papers
3. **Idea Ranker**: Uses pairwise comparisons to rank ideas by quality 
4. **Style Normalizer**: Standardizes writing style to eliminate AI vs. human cues
5. **Evaluation Framework**: Analyzes idea quality with statistical rigor

The implementation is fully modular and configurable via YAML configuration files.
