3. **Implementation Planning**: Bridge the gap between research and implementation by automatically planning, generating, and testing code based on research papers, with support for Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and R.

4. **Temporal Evolution Analysis**: Track how AI concepts, models, and architectures evolve over time with temporal analysis, visualizations, and trend prediction. Discover research acceleration, stagnation patterns, and knowledge gaps.

5. **Team Collaboration**: Work together with your team using workspaces, hierarchical tagging, comments, and version control features designed for research collaboration. Share knowledge graphs and federate instances.

6. **Paper Processing Pipeline**: Automatically process, analyze, and extract structured information from research papers with our specialized pipeline supporting PDF, HTML, LaTeX, and text formats with real-time WebSocket updates.

## Architecture

The platform is built with a modern, modular architecture:

1. **API Layer**: FastAPI-based RESTful API with JWT authentication, Pydantic models, and comprehensive error handling
2. **Knowledge Graph System**: Neo4j-based graph database with customized schema for AI research entities, temporal versioning, and advanced query optimization
3. **Research Orchestration Engine**: Multi-agent framework coordinating search operations, knowledge extraction, and content generation with configurable pipelines
4. **Implementation Planning System**: Task decomposition engine for converting research papers to code implementations with automated testing and validation
5. **Frontend Layer**: React/TypeScript UI with D3.js visualizations, hierarchical tagging, and collaborative features
6. **Asynchronous Processing**: Celery/Redis task queue system with error handling, retry mechanisms, and dead letter queues for robust paper processing

## Getting Started

### Running with Docker

The easiest way to get started is using Docker Compose:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-research-integration.git
cd ai-research-integration

# Start all services
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start:
- The landing page at http://localhost:3000
- The API at http://localhost:8000
- Neo4j database at bolt://localhost:7687 (Web UI: http://localhost:7474)
- MongoDB at mongodb://localhost:27017

### API Documentation

Once the services are running, you can access the API documentation at:
- http://localhost:3000/api/docs (Swagger UI)
- http://localhost:3000/api/redoc (ReDoc)

## Theme and Design System

The platform follows a consistent design system documented in [THEME.md](THEME.md). The design system includes:

- Color palette with primary, secondary, and accent colors
- Typography guidelines
- UI component styling
- Accessibility considerations

All new components and pages should adhere to this design system for a consistent user experience.

## Development

### API Development

The API is built with FastAPI. To run the API in development mode:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt -r requirements-api.txt

# Run the API with auto-reload
uvicorn src.api.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Frontend Development

The landing page is built with Express.js:

```bash
# Navigate to the landing page directory
cd src/ui/landing

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### Running Tests

The project has a comprehensive test suite. To run the tests:

```bash
# Install test dependencies
pip install -r requirements-test.txt

# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/

# Run specific test modules
python -m pytest tests/research_orchestrator/knowledge_extraction/

# Run with coverage report
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=xml
```

## Inspiration Sources

This project draws inspiration from several cutting-edge AI research frameworks and tools:

### 1. [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)
LangChain provides components and interfaces for developing applications powered by language models. Our research orchestration framework adopts similar principles for chaining complex AI operations into cohesive pipelines. We particularly drew inspiration from LangChain's document processing capabilities and agent architecture.

### 2. [LlamaIndex](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index)
LlamaIndex (formerly GPT Index) offers tools for connecting custom data sources to large language models. Our knowledge extraction pipeline is influenced by LlamaIndex's document processing and structured output generation techniques. The knowledge graph integration components mirror LlamaIndex's approach to structured data retrieval.

### 3. [Neo4j Graph Data Science Library](https://github.com/neo4j/graph-data-science)
Neo4j's Graph Data Science Library provides enterprise-grade graph algorithms for data scientists. Our temporal evolution system adopts similar approaches for graph pattern discovery, path finding, and centrality algorithms. The community detection and similarity computation techniques directly informed our research field analysis components.

### 4. [Hugging Face Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers)
The Transformers library by Hugging Face offers thousands of pre-trained models for various NLP tasks. Our entity recognition system leverages similar architecture for extracting research concepts, while our research generation system adopts comparable approaches to controlled text generation.
