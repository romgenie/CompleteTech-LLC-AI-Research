## Usage Guide

### Research Orchestration

The Research Orchestration Framework allows you to conduct AI research and generate comprehensive reports:

```python
from research_orchestrator.core import ResearchOrchestrator

# Initialize the orchestrator
orchestrator = ResearchOrchestrator()

# Process a research query
result = orchestrator.process_query("How do Vision Transformers work?")

# Generate a report
report = orchestrator.generate_report(result)

# Export the report to markdown
orchestrator.export_report(report, "vision_transformers_report.md")
```

### Knowledge Graph

The Knowledge Graph System allows you to store and query AI research knowledge:

```python
from knowledge_graph_system.core import KnowledgeGraphManager
from knowledge_graph_system.utils.query_optimizer import QueryOptimizer

# Connect to Neo4j
kg_manager = KnowledgeGraphManager()

# Add entities and relationships
model_id = kg_manager.add_entity({"type": "MODEL", "name": "Vision Transformer"})
dataset_id = kg_manager.add_entity({"type": "DATASET", "name": "ImageNet"})
kg_manager.add_relationship(model_id, dataset_id, "EVALUATED_ON", {"accuracy": 0.885})

# Optimize queries
optimizer = QueryOptimizer(kg_manager.neo4j)
optimizer.enable_query_caching()

# Get implementation context for a model
context = kg_manager.get_implementation_context("Vision Transformer")
```

### Research Implementation

The Research Implementation System allows you to generate code from research papers:

```python
from research_implementation.core import ImplementationManager

# Initialize the implementation manager
impl_manager = ImplementationManager()

# Create an implementation from a paper and context
implementation = impl_manager.create_implementation(
    topic="Vision Transformer",
    context={
        "model": {"name": "Vision Transformer", "type": "Transformer"},
        "papers": [{"title": "An Image is Worth 16x16 Words", "year": 2021}],
        "components": ["PatchEmbedding", "TransformerEncoder", "ClassificationHead"]
    }
)

# Export the implementation
impl_manager.export_implementation(implementation, "vision_transformer_impl")
```
