## Project Overview

The AI Research Integration Project consists of three main systems:

1. **Research Orchestration Framework**: An end-to-end research assistant that coordinates the entire research process from query to report generation
2. **Dynamic Knowledge Graph System**: A system for building and maintaining knowledge graphs of AI research to identify patterns, trends, and gaps
3. **AI Research Implementation System**: A system that automatically implements, tests, and validates AI research concepts from papers

## Technology Stack

- Python 3.9+ for core development
- Neo4j for knowledge graph storage
- FastAPI for API development
- Docker and Docker Compose for containerization

## Architecture Design

The project follows a modular architecture with well-defined interfaces between components. Each system is designed to work both independently and as part of an integrated whole. The adapter pattern is used for all external repository integrations to ensure loose coupling.

## Getting Started

1. Explore the documentation in CLAUDE.md and the plan/ directory
2. Install dependencies from requirements.txt
3. Configure environment variables using .env (based on .env.example)
4. Run tests to verify the installation

## Development Guidelines

- PEP 8 compliant Python code
- Comprehensive type hints
- Google style docstrings
- 80%+ test coverage for all components
