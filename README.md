### Authentication
- Test credentials: username: `admin`, password: `password`

## üìä Key Components

### Research Orchestration

The Research Orchestration Framework coordinates the entire research process:

- **Research Planning**: Develops structured research plans with comprehensive outlines
- **Information Gathering**: Collects data from academic sources, web searches, and code repositories
- **Knowledge Extraction**: Identifies entities and relationships from research content
- **Report Generation**: Creates cohesive research reports with proper citations and visualizations

### Knowledge Graph

The Knowledge Graph System builds and maintains a graph of AI research knowledge:

- **Entity Types**: Models, algorithms, datasets, papers, authors, institutions, and more
- **Relationship Types**: Trained-on, outperforms, cites, builds-upon, authored-by, and others
- **Visualization**: Interactive graph exploration with filtering, zooming, and node selection
- **Query Capabilities**: Advanced search for paths, connections, and research insights

### Research Implementation

The Research Implementation System generates code from research papers:

- **Paper Analysis**: Extracts algorithms, architectures, and implementation details
- **Code Generation**: Creates executable implementations in multiple programming languages
- **Validation**: Compares implementations against original research specifications
- **Traceability**: Maintains connections between code and source papers
