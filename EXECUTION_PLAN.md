# Execution Plan: Final System Integration

Based on the current project status, this document outlines the critical next steps to complete the AI Research Integration Project.

## Priority 1: Fix API Integration Issues

### 1.1. Debug and Fix API Route Configuration
- Fix the 422 validation errors in knowledge graph and research endpoints
- Examine FastAPI dependency injection for proper query parameter handling
- Update API client tests to match the actual API interface

### 1.2. Resolve Implementation Endpoint 404 Errors
- Verify the implementation router is correctly registered
- Check that route paths are consistent with API documentation
- Fix any missing implementation endpoints

### 1.3. Complete WebSocket Integration
- Implement missing WebSocket integration tests
- Ensure real-time updates are properly delivered for paper processing
- Create test fixtures for WebSocket event simulation

## Priority 2: Complete Test Implementation

### 2.1. Implement Missing Tests
- Complete Celery task tests for asynchronous processing
- Add frontend integration tests for API clients and authentication flow
- Implement end-to-end tests for user authentication flow

### 2.2. Fix Skipped Tests
- Address the skipped test for knowledge graph entity handling
- Improve fixture design for entities with relationship references
- Fix any remaining mock entity issues

### 2.3. Enhance Test Coverage
- Add more parameterized tests for components with low coverage
- Create tests for edge cases in entity and relationship extraction
- Improve test organization with dedicated fixture files

## Priority 3: Enhance CI/CD Pipeline

### 3.1. Improve GitHub Actions Workflow
- Add badges for test status and coverage reporting
- Configure automated deployment testing
- Optimize workflow for faster test execution

### 3.2. Fix Failing Tests in CI
- Resolve any environment-specific issues causing tests to fail in CI
- Create consistent test environment across local and CI environments
- Implement proper mocking for external dependencies

### 3.3. Documentation and Reporting
- Update testing documentation with latest improvements
- Configure comprehensive test reports in CI
- Create monitoring dashboard for test status

## Timeline

## Success Criteria

This phase will be considered successfully completed when:

1. All API endpoints return expected responses with proper status codes
2. Test coverage reaches at least 85% for critical components
3. CI/CD pipeline runs all tests successfully
4. WebSocket integration is fully functional and tested
5. No tests are skipped or failing in the CI environment
