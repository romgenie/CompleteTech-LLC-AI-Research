# Knowledge Graph UI Improvement Plan

## Current Issues

1. **Display Mode Limitations**:
   - Current options (List, Detail, Form) are useful but don't reflect how users actually work with knowledge graphs
   - Switching between modes requires going back to the controls section
   - No visual indication of what each mode looks like

2. **Height Control Issues**:
   - Fixed height options (400px, 600px, 800px) are inflexible
   - No option to expand to full viewport
   - No responsive adaptation for different screen sizes and devices
   - Height control requires going back to the controls panel

## Improved User Experience Plan

### Enhanced Display Modes

1. **Introduce Split View Mode**
   - Allow users to see list and detail/graph simultaneously
   - Implement horizontal or vertical split options
   - Enable drag-to-resize the split areas

2. **Add Graph-Centric Mode**
   - Make the graph visualization the primary view with entity details as sidebars
   - Include mini-map for navigation in large graphs
   - Allow zooming and panning

3. **Card View Option**
   - Add a grid/card layout alternative to the list
   - Better for visual scanning of many entities

4. **Mode Switching Improvements**
   - Add mode toggle buttons directly in the content area
   - Include visual icons for each mode
   - Implement keyboard shortcuts for power users
   - Remember user's preferred mode

### Flexible Height & Layout Management

1. **Smart Defaults**
   - Default to responsive height based on viewport
   - Remember user's last setting

2. **Improved Height Controls**
   - Add a resize handle at the bottom of the component
   - Include a "Maximize" button to expand to available space
   - Add "Fit to Content" option that adjusts height based on content

3. **Responsive Design**
   - Adapt layout based on screen size
   - Collapse/expand sections automatically on small screens
   - Optimize for mobile with appropriate touch targets

4. **Full-screen Option**
   - Add a button to enter full-screen mode
   - Especially useful for graph visualization

## Implementation Plan

1. **Layout Component Refactoring**
   - Create a flexible layout container component
   - Implement resize handlers and position management
   - Support multiple layout configurations

2. **State Management Improvements**
   - Track user preferences and save to localStorage
   - Implement responsive breakpoints

3. **UI Enhancement**
   - Add intuitive controls directly in the interface
   - Create visual previews for display modes
   - Implement smooth transitions between states

4. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Ensure keyboard navigation works across all modes
   - Add ARIA attributes for screen readers
   - Test with different input methods

## Priority Features

1. Split view with resizable panels
2. In-content mode switcher with visual indicators
3. Resizable height with drag handle
4. Responsive layout adaptation
5. User preference persistence

## User Stories

### Researcher
"As a researcher, I want to be able to see the graph visualization and entity details simultaneously so I can explore connections without losing context."

### Data Analyst
"As a data analyst, I need to quickly scan through many entities and sort them by different attributes to identify patterns and outliers."

### Content Manager
"As a content manager, I need to efficiently add and edit entities on different devices, with an interface that adapts to my available screen space."

### Knowledge Engineer
"As a knowledge engineer, I want to focus on the graph structure and be able to expand it to full screen when exploring complex relationships."
