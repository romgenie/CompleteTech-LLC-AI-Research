  - Set up code coverage reporting and test result collection
  - Automated testing on pull requests and main branch commits
- **Test Runner Script**: ✅ Implemented
  - Created `/run_tests.sh` for consistent local and CI execution
  - Configured to run all tests or specific test modules

## Current Issues

1. **API Route Validation Issues**:
   - FastAPI routes are rejecting requests with 422 Unprocessable Entity errors
   - The error is: `{"detail":[{"type":"missing","loc":["query","args"],"msg":"Field required","input":null},{"type":"missing","loc":["query","kwargs"],"msg":"Field required","input":null}]}`
   - This suggests there's an issue with how the test client is configured or how the dependencies are being injected

2. **Implementation Endpoints Not Found**:
   - 404 errors for implementation endpoints suggests the routes may be different than expected

3. **Knowledge Graph Entity Creation**:
   - One test (`test_create_knowledge_graph_with_entities`) remains skipped due to issues with mock entity handling
   - Need to improve fixture design for entities with relationship references

## Next Steps

1. **Implement WebSocket Tests**:
   - Create directory structure and test files for WebSocket tests
   - Implement fixtures for WebSocket testing as outlined in the test plan
   - Add tests for connection, paper events, and system events
   - Integrate WebSocket tests with the CI pipeline

2. **Complete Skipped Test Fixes**:
   - Fix remaining issue with `test_create_knowledge_graph_with_entities`
   - Fix integration tests for relationship extraction
   - Complete implementation of all skipped tests

3. **Implement Missing Tests**:
   - Add Celery task tests for asynchronous processing
   - Create frontend integration tests for API clients
   - Implement end-to-end tests for user authentication flow

4. **Enhance Test Structure and Organization**:
   - Add more specialized fixtures in component-specific test files
   - Enhance parameterized tests for broader coverage
   - Increase test coverage for core components

5. **Expand CI/CD Capabilities**:
   - Add badges for test status and coverage
   - Configure automated deployment testing
   - Set up performance monitoring for tests
