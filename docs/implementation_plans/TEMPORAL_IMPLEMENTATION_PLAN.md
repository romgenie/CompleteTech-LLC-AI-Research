               {"point_in_time": point_in_time}
           )
       
       def query_evolution_path(self, entity_id: str) -> Dict:
           """Query the complete evolution path of an entity."""
           cypher_query = """
           MATCH (e {id: $entity_id})
           CALL {

               WHERE NOT ()-[:EVOLVED_INTO]->(earliest)
               RETURN path as backward_path
           }
           RETURN forward_path, backward_path
           """
