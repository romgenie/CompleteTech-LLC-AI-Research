## API Integration Tests 

- **Authentication Tests**: ✅ Passing
- **Knowledge Graph API Tests**: ⛔ Failing
  - Error: 422 validation errors with message: `{"detail":[{"type":"missing","loc":["query","args"],"msg":"Field required","input":null},{"type":"missing","loc":["query","kwargs"],"msg":"Field required","input":null}]}`
  - Appears to be issue with test client or route configuration
- **Research API Tests**: ⛔ Failing
  - Same validation errors as knowledge graph endpoints
- **Implementation API Tests**: ⛔ Failing
  - 404 errors for implementation endpoints

## Frontend Integration Tests

- **API Client Tests**: ⚠️ Not Implemented
- **Authentication Flow Tests**: ⚠️ Not Implemented
- **Knowledge Graph Visualization Tests**: ⚠️ Not Implemented

## End-to-End Tests

- **Research to Implementation Flow**: ⛔ Failing
  - Fixed the ChartType.NETWORK errors in visualization_generator.py and content_synthesis.py
  - Still failing on content_synthesis.generate_content function not found
- **User Authentication Flow**: ⚠️ Not Implemented

## Current Issues

1. **API Route Validation Issues**:
   - FastAPI routes are rejecting requests with 422 Unprocessable Entity errors
   - The error is: `{"detail":[{"type":"missing","loc":["query","args"],"msg":"Field required","input":null},{"type":"missing","loc":["query","kwargs"],"msg":"Field required","input":null}]}`
   - This suggests there's an issue with how the test client is configured or how the dependencies are being injected

2. **Implementation Endpoints Not Found**:
   - 404 errors for implementation endpoints suggests the routes may be different than expected

3. **Research to Implementation Flow**:
   - Content synthesis module is expecting a specific function interface

## Next Steps

1. Debug FastAPI route configuration:
   - Check for issues with middleware or custom routers that might be affecting query parameter handling
   - Examine FastAPI dependency injection for our routes
   - Consider updating tests to match actual API interface

2. Fix implementation endpoint 404 errors:
   - Verify actual API route paths
   - Check that implementation router is correctly registered

3. Fix content synthesis test setup:
   - Update test mocks to match actual function signatures
