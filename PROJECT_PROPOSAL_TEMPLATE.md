# Project Proposal Template

1. **Title**: A concise statement of the main research question to be used as the paper title.

2. **Problem Statement**: Clearly define the problem your research intends to address. Explain clearly why this problem is interesting and important.

3. **Motivation**: Explain why existing methods are not good enough to solve the problem, and explain the inspiration behind the new proposed method. You should also motivate why the proposed method would work better than existing baselines on the problem.

4. **Proposed Method**: Explain how the proposed method works, describe all the essential steps.

5. **Step-by-Step Experiment Plan**: Break down every single step of the experiments, make sure every step is executable. Cover all essential details such as the datasets, models, and metrics to be used. If the project involves prompting, give some example prompts for each step.

6. **Test Case Examples**: Give at least two concrete examples. The first example should show how the baseline method fails on the test case. If there are multiple baselines, give examples for all of them. The second example should show how the proposed method succeeds on the test case. For each test case, include the input (test example and the full prompt) and the expected output. You should also provide an explanation for why the outputs from the proposed prompt are better. If the proposed method has multiple steps, break them down into intermediate steps.

7. **Fallback Plan**: Propose some alternative plans for what should the students do if the proposed method doesn't manage to satisfy the success criteria. For example, you can suggest additional analysis to help debug why the proposed method didn't work, which could inform alternative new methods, or just turn the project into an analysis paper instead by offering some interesting ablation and insights.
