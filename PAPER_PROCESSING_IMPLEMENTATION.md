# Paper Processing Pipeline Implementation Guide

This document outlines the implementation approach for the Paper Processing Pipeline (Phase 3.5) with a focus on practical engineering considerations. This guide complements the PAPER_PROCESSING_PROMPT.md document with additional technical and architectural guidance.

## System Architecture

The Paper Processing Pipeline employs a layered architecture:

1. **API Layer**: FastAPI endpoints for paper upload and management
2. **State Management Layer**: PaperStateMachine for lifecycle tracking
3. **Processing Layer**: Document processors and knowledge extractors
4. **Task Management Layer**: Celery and Redis for asynchronous processing
5. **Integration Layer**: Connections to Knowledge Graph and Implementation systems

## Core Technology Stack

- **FastAPI**: For REST API and WebSocket endpoints
- **Celery**: For asynchronous task processing
- **Redis**: As broker and result backend
- **PyPDF2/PDFMiner**: For PDF document processing
- **BeautifulSoup**: For HTML content extraction
- **Neo4j**: For knowledge graph storage (existing)
- **MongoDB**: For paper document storage

## Key Design Patterns

1. **State Machine Pattern**: For paper processing lifecycle management
2. **Factory Pattern**: For document processor and extractor creation
3. **Adapter Pattern**: For integration with existing systems
4. **Repository Pattern**: For data access abstraction
5. **Decorator Pattern**: For state transitions and error handling

## Implementation Focus Areas

### 1. Asynchronous Processing Architecture

#### Design Considerations
- Task granularity should balance parallelism with overhead
- Use proper queue structure to prioritize important papers
- Implement robust retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Add dead letter queues for failed tasks with notification system
- Design all tasks to be idempotent for safe retries

#### Implementation Guidelines
```python
# Example: Task decorator with idempotency protection
def idempotent_task(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(paper_id, *args, **kwargs):
        # Check if task has already completed
        from paper_processing.repositories import task_repository
        task_key = f"{func.__name__}:{paper_id}"
        if task_repository.is_completed(task_key):
            logger.info(f"Task {task_key} already completed, skipping")
            return task_repository.get_result(task_key)
            
        # Execute task
        result = func(paper_id, *args, **kwargs)
        
        # Mark as completed
        task_repository.mark_completed(task_key, result)
        return result
    return wrapper
```

### 2. Paper Lifecycle Management

#### Design Considerations
- Create atomic and transactional state transitions
- Implement proper error recovery for failed transitions
- Track full processing history with timestamps for analytics
- Ensure state machine rules are centralized and consistently applied
- Add event emission for WebSocket notifications

#### Implementation Guidelines
```python
# Example: Transactional state change
def transition_state(paper_id, from_state, to_state, metadata=None):
    """
    Perform state transition with transaction support.
    Returns True if transition succeeded, False otherwise.
    """
    from paper_processing.repositories import state_history_repository
    from paper_processing.db import get_transaction
    
    with get_transaction() as tx:
        try:
            # Get current state
            history = state_history_repository.get(paper_id, tx=tx)
            
            # Verify current state matches expected from_state
            if history.current_state() != from_state:
                logger.error(f"Cannot transition {paper_id} from {from_state} to {to_state}: " 
                            f"current state is {history.current_state()}")
                return False
                
            # Add transition
            history.add_transition(from_state, to_state, metadata)
            
            # Save updated history
            state_history_repository.save(history, tx=tx)
            
            # Commit transaction
            tx.commit()
            
            # Publish event after successful commit
            publish_state_change_event(paper_id, from_state, to_state, metadata)
            
            return True
        except Exception as e:
            # Rollback transaction on error
            tx.rollback()
            logger.error(f"Error transitioning {paper_id} from {from_state} to {to_state}: {e}")
            return False
```

### 3. Document Processing Integration

#### Design Considerations
- Create extensible framework for supporting new document types
- Implement efficient content extraction with chunking for large documents
- Add preprocessing to normalize content for better extraction
- Integrate with knowledge extraction systems via clean interfaces
- Handle structural elements (sections, figures, tables) with proper parsing

#### Implementation Guidelines
```python
# Example: Document chunking for large papers
def chunk_document(content, max_chunk_size=5000, overlap=500):
    """
    Split large documents into overlapping chunks for processing.
    Returns list of chunks with position information.
    """
    chunks = []
    content_length = len(content)
    
    for start_pos in range(0, content_length, max_chunk_size - overlap):
        end_pos = min(start_pos + max_chunk_size, content_length)
        
        # Create chunk with position information
        chunk = {
            "content": content[start_pos:end_pos],
            "start_pos": start_pos,
            "end_pos": end_pos,
            "is_first": start_pos == 0,
            "is_last": end_pos == content_length
        }
        
        chunks.append(chunk)
        
        # Stop if we've reached the end
        if end_pos == content_length:
            break
            
    return chunks
```

### 4. WebSocket Integration

#### Design Considerations
- Use connection pooling for efficient WebSocket management
- Implement paper-specific subscriptions for filtered updates
- Add authentication and authorization for secure connections
- Ensure proper disconnection handling and cleanup
- Create standardized message format for consistent communication

#### Implementation Guidelines
```python
# Example: Standard WebSocket message format
def create_status_message(paper_id, status, progress=None, details=None):
    """
    Create standardized WebSocket message for paper status updates.
    """
    message = {
        "type": "paper_status",
        "paper_id": paper_id,
        "status": status,
        "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
    }
    
    if progress is not None:
        message["progress"] = progress
        
    if details:
        message["details"] = details
        
    return message
```

### 5. Algorithm Extraction

#### Design Considerations
- Implement pattern-based detection for common algorithm formats
- Add context analysis for more accurate extraction
- Create proper parsing for inputs, outputs, and complexity information
- Integrate with existing implementation system via clear interfaces
- Add validation to ensure extracted algorithms are complete and usable

#### Implementation Guidelines
```python
# Example: Multimodal algorithm detection
def detect_algorithms(paper_content, paper_metadata):
    """
    Detect algorithms using multiple methods for better coverage.
    Returns list of detected algorithms with details.
    """
    algorithms = []
    
    # Method 1: Pattern-based detection
    pattern_algorithms = detect_algorithms_by_pattern(paper_content)
    algorithms.extend(pattern_algorithms)
    
    # Method 2: Section-based detection (look for "Algorithm" sections)
    section_algorithms = detect_algorithms_by_section(paper_content)
    algorithms.extend([a for a in section_algorithms if not algorithm_exists(a, algorithms)])
    
    # Method 3: Reference-based detection (look for algorithm mentions in references)
    if paper_metadata.get("references"):
        reference_algorithms = detect_algorithms_by_references(paper_metadata["references"])
        algorithms.extend([a for a in reference_algorithms if not algorithm_exists(a, algorithms)])
    
    # Deduplicate and merge algorithms
    return deduplicate_algorithms(algorithms)
```
