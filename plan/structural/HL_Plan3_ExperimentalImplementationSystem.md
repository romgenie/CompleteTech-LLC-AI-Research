# High-Level Structural Plan 3: AI Research Implementation System

## Overview
A system designed to bridge the gap between theoretical AI research and practical implementation. By leveraging AutoCodeAgent2.0's code generation capabilities along with TDAG's task decomposition, GDesigner's agent communication, and knowledge from both open_deep_research and KARMA, this system can automatically implement, test, and validate AI research concepts, enabling researchers to rapidly prototype new ideas and reproduce existing work.

## Core Components
1. **Research Understanding Engine** - Processes AI research papers and concepts to extract implementable details
2. **Implementation Planning System** - Creates structured plans for implementing AI techniques
3. **Code Generation Pipeline** - Produces working code implementations of AI methods
4. **Experiment Management Framework** - Designs, runs, and analyzes AI experiments
5. **Research Verification System** - Validates results against published claims and metrics

## Key Capabilities
- Automatic code generation from AI research papers
- Reproduction of experiments described in publications
- Comparative evaluation of different AI approaches
- Novel combination of research techniques from different sources
- Hypothesis testing through automated experimentation

## Integration Points
- AutoCodeAgent2.0 for code generation and execution
- TDAG for task decomposition and planning
- GDesigner for agent-based experimental design
- open_deep_research for gathering implementation details
- KARMA for extracting structured knowledge from papers
