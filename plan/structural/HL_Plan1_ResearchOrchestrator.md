# High-Level Structural Plan 1: AI Research Orchestration Framework

## Overview
An orchestration framework that leverages multiple agent types to automate and enhance the AI research discovery process. This system combines the planning capabilities of TDAG, the research abilities of open_deep_research, the graph-based agent communication of GDesigner, and the knowledge extraction of KARMA to create a comprehensive research assistant for AI knowledge discovery.

## Core Components
1. **Research Planning Coordinator** - Creates structured research plans based on queries
2. **Information Gathering System** - Collects data from multiple sources with specialized retrieval
3. **Knowledge Extraction Pipeline** - Processes collected information into structured knowledge
4. **Graph-based Knowledge Integration** - Organizes discovered knowledge into interconnected graphs
5. **Research Generation System** - Produces comprehensive reports, papers, or code implementations

## Key Capabilities
- Autonomous formulation of research questions and hypotheses
- Multi-source information retrieval (academic papers, code repositories, web)
- Extraction of concepts, methods, and relationships from research literature
- Knowledge synthesis across multiple papers and sources
- Generation of new research directions and experimental designs

## Integration Points
- TDAG for task decomposition and planning
- open_deep_research for structured information gathering
- GDesigner for agent communication optimization
- KARMA for knowledge extraction and graph construction
- AutoCodeAgent2.0 for code generation and implementation
