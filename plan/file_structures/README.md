# File Structures for AI Research Integration

This directory contains detailed file structures for implementing the three architectural plans:

## Overview

Each file structure document provides:
- Complete directory structure
- File organization
- Component relationships
- Integration approaches
- Key design decisions

## File Structures

### 1. [AI Research Orchestration Framework](./ResearchOrchestrator_FileStructure.md)

A modular file structure for the research orchestration system with a focus on:
- Clean separation of concerns
- Adapter pattern for external integrations
- API-first design for flexibility
- Configuration management

### 2. [Dynamic Knowledge Graph System](./KnowledgeGraphSystem_FileStructure.md)

A deeper hierarchical structure for the knowledge graph system with:
- Neo4j database integration
- Domain-driven design principles
- Microservice-ready architecture
- Multiple API paradigms (REST, GraphQL, WebSocket)

### 3. [AI Research Implementation System](./ExperimentalImplementation_FileStructure.md)

A comprehensive file structure for the research implementation system featuring:
- Framework-agnostic code generation
- Extensive testing infrastructure
- Multiple user interfaces
- Clear separation between research understanding and implementation
- Experiment-centric design

## Common Patterns

All three file structures share these common patterns:

1. **Adapter Pattern**: External systems are integrated through adapter modules
2. **Configuration Management**: Separate configuration files for different aspects
3. **Core System Coordination**: A central core module manages system components
4. **API-Based Design**: All systems expose APIs for programmatic access
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: Extensive test directories for quality assurance
