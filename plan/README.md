# AI Research Integration Plans

This directory contains architectural plans for integrating multiple agent-based AI systems for research and knowledge discovery.

## Overview

The structural plans combine capabilities from these repositories:
- AutoCodeAgent2.0
- TDAG (Task Decomposition Agent Generation)
- GDesigner
- KARMA
- open_deep_research

## Plan Structure

Each plan follows a hierarchical structure:

1. **High-Level (HL)** - Overview, core components, key capabilities, and integration points
2. **Mid-Level (ML)** - Detailed breakdown of each core component into subsystems 
3. **Low-Level (LL)** - Comprehensive specification of all individual modules and functionality

## Plans

### Plan 1: AI Research Orchestration Framework

A comprehensive research assistant that orchestrates the entire research process from planning to report generation.

- [High-Level Plan](./structural/HL_Plan1_ResearchOrchestrator.md)
- [Mid-Level Plan](./structural/ML_Plan1_ResearchOrchestrator.md)
- [Low-Level Plan](./structural/LL_Plan1_ResearchOrchestrator.md)

### Plan 2: Dynamic Knowledge Graph System for AI Research

A system focused on building, maintaining, and leveraging knowledge graphs to identify patterns, trends, and gaps in AI research.

- [High-Level Plan](./structural/HL_Plan2_KnowledgeGraphSystem.md)
- [Mid-Level Plan](./structural/ML_Plan2_KnowledgeGraphSystem.md)
- [Low-Level Plan](./structural/LL_Plan2_KnowledgeGraphSystem.md)

### Plan 3: AI Research Implementation System

A system that bridges theoretical AI research and practical implementation through automated code generation and experimentation.

- [High-Level Plan](./structural/HL_Plan3_ExperimentalImplementationSystem.md)
- [Mid-Level Plan](./structural/ML_Plan3_ExperimentalImplementationSystem.md)
- [Low-Level Plan](./structural/LL_Plan3_ExperimentalImplementationSystem.md)
